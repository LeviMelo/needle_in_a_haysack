      "title": "Ultrasonographic Assessment of Metoclopramide Administration Effectiveness in Accelerating Gastric Emptying Before Urgent Surgery in Patients with Insufficient NPO Time.",
      "abstract": "Aspiration is one of the important complications of general anesthesia, although infrequent as well as accompanying high morbidity and mortality. The volume of gastric content is considered as a risk factor in this regard. Therefore, it is normally mostly recommend to consider proper fasting time before induction of general anesthesia. This study was conducted to assess the effect of metoclopramide on reducing gastric contents in patients with incomplete fasting before induction of general anesthesia. This quasi-experimental study was conducted on patients with urgent surgical indications with incomplete NPO time. Every other patient received metoclopramide or placebo. Patients in the intervention group received 10 mg (2 ml) of intravenous metoclopramide, and patients in the control group received 2 ml of distilled water as a placebo. Patients in both groups underwent ultrasonography before starting surgery by an expert radiologist to calculate gastric antral grade (GAG) and cross-sectional antral area (CSA). These measurements were then taken for the second time 30 minutes after intervention, before starting the surgery. The values were compared statistically. The data of 60 patients were analyzed, of which 30 were in each group. The mean age, body mass index, type of the last consumed food (solid or fluid), NPO time in the two groups were not significantly different (P value > 0.05). The number of patients in the metoclopramide group with higher GAG (P value = 0.001) and the mean CSA (P value = 0.004) before the intervention was more than the control group. The GAG and mean CSA after intervention were not significantly different between the two groups; but the mean difference of decrease in CSA in the metoclopramide group was more than the control group (4.3 vs. 0.99; P value = 0.001), and changes of GAG after intervention to lower levels in the metoclopramide group was more than the control group (P value < 0.05). In the current study in which ultrasonographic indexes, including GAG and CSA, were assessed as a suboptimal gastric emptying test method, it was found that metoclopramide could accelerate gastric emptying compared to placebo in patients with incomplete fasting before induction of general anesthesia.",

      "title": "Comparison of gastric emptying time between breast-fed and formula milk-fed infants less than 6 months old, using gastric ultrasound-An observational study.",
      "abstract": "Fasting before elective anesthesia care is a standardized practice worldwide. The aim is to decrease the risk of aspiration leading to pulmonary complications such as aspiration pneumonitis during anesthesia care. There are different guidelines for elective preoperative fasting in children. However, there is insufficient literature measuring gastric emptying time after breast milk or formula milk feeding in infants. This study used gastric ultrasound to determine the gastric emptying time for breast milk and formula milk in children below 6 months of age. We also compared the calculated gastric volumes among breast-fed and formula milk-fed based on Schmitz's and Spencer's formula. This prospective observational study was conducted at a tertiary care center in India between November (2017-2019). A total of 52 infants less than 6 months of age were recruited. The study population was divided into two groups (breast-fed and formula milk-fed) of 26 patients each. Ultrasound was used to measure the antral cross-sectional area of the stomach and to calculate the gastric volume using the two classical formulas (Schmitz and Spencer's). Gastric emptying was reported when the bull's eye appearance of the gastric antrum was seen or when the antral cross-sectional area was less than 3.07 cm2. The number of breast-fed children whose antral cross-sectional was greater than 3.07 cm2 (cut-off value for aspiration risk) beyond 1 h was 14/26 (53.84%) while none (0) children went beyond 3 h. The number of formula-fed children whose antral cross-sectional was greater than 3.07 cm2 beyond 1 h was 17/26 (65.38%) while one child (3.84%) went beyond 3 h. Using Schmitz's formula, mean (SD) gastric emptying times were 0.35 ± 0.68 h (95% CI 0.35 ± 0.185, range 0.165-0.535) for breast-fed patients and 0.35 ± 0.69 h (95% CI 0.35 ± 0.188, range 0.162-0.538) for formula-fed patients, and were thus neither clinically nor statistically different (p = .73) Using Spencer's formula, the mean gastric emptying times were 0.12 ± 0.33 h (95% CI 0.12 ± 0.09, range 0.03-0.21) for breast-fed patients and 0.04 ± 0.20 h (95% CI 0.04 ± 0.05, range -0.01 to 0.09) for formula-fed patients, and were also neither clinically nor statistically different p = .13. In our series, the gastric emptying times in breast-fed and formula-fed infants less than 6 months old were similar. Our results support the fasting guidelines of the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care 2022, that is, 3 h for breastfeeding and 4 h for formula milk feeding. In addition, this shows that the Schmitz's and Spencer's formulae used to calculate the gastric volume based on ultrasound measurement of the antral cross-sectional area are not comparable in infants less than 6 months.",

      "abstract": "In this prospective observational study, an ultrasonographic measurement of antral cross-sectional area (ACSA) was conducted to evaluate the gastric content and volume as well as to identify high-risk stomach in non-pregnant adult surgical patients adhering to preanesthetic fasting guidelines. Fasted patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy under sedation were included. Ultrasonographic measurements of ACSA were conducted in both semi-recumbent and right lateral decubitus positions before endoscopic procedures. Gastroscopy was employed to guide the measurement of suctioned gastric volume (GV). Ultrasonography was performed to assess gastric contents and identify patients with high-risk stomach. The relationship between ACSA and suctioned GV was also evaluated. ACSA was evaluated in 736 out of 782 patients. A significant positive correlation was discovered between ACSA in the right lateral decubitus position and suctioned GV, which was more reliable than in the semi-recumbent position. To analyze high-risk stomach with a GV > 100 mL, the cutoff value of ACSA in the right lateral decubitus was found to be 7.5 cm2, with the AUC, sensitivity and specificity of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.76-0.82; P<0.001), 82.4% and 67.3%, respectively. A novel mathematical model based on ACSA to estimate GV in non-pregnant fasted adults was presented. Ultrasonographic measurement of ACSA can assist anesthesiologists in estimating the risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents during general anesthesia and sedation.",

      "abstract": "Main-duct (MD-) and mixed-type (MT-) IPMNs harbor an increased risk of pancreatic cancer and warrant surgical resection. Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) are important in the diagnosis of IPMNs. The aim of this study was to investigate whether endoscopic procedures manipulating the MD impact postoperative adverse events in patients with MD- and MT-IPMNs. We performed a retrospective study of 369 patients who underwent resections for MD- or MT-IPMN at two tertiary centers (2000-2019). Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed for postoperative adverse events to compare the risks between intervention (ERCP, EUS-FNA with branch duct (BD) aspirated, EUS-FNA with MD aspirated from the duct directly or cyst/mass arising from MD) versus no-intervention group. 33.1 % of patients had a preoperative ERCP and 69.4 % had EUS-FNA. Postoperative adverse events included: 30-day readmission (12.7 %), delayed gastric emptying (13.8 %), pancreatic fistula (10.3 %), abdominal abscess (5.7 %), cardiopulmonary adverse events (11.4 %), and mortality (1.4 %). The model was adjusted for potential confounders. There were no significant differences between the ERCP and no-ERCP groups for specific adverse events. Compared to no-EUS-FNA groups, groups of EUS-FNA with BD aspiration and EUS-FNA with MD aspiration from the main pancreatic duct directly or cyst/mass arising from MD did not show a significant increase in specific adverse events. Postoperative adverse events were not significantly increased among patients who had ERCP or EUS-FNA before surgical resection for MD- or MT-IPMNs. Endoscopic procedures directly sampling the MD can be safely pursued for diagnostic purposes in selected cases.",

      "abstract": "The diagnostic accuracy of gastric ultrasound in children has not been assessed thoroughly. We aimed to determine the sensitivity and specificity in children of a qualitative ultrasound examination of the gastric antrum in the supine 45° semi-recumbent position and a clinical algorithm for detecting a gastric fluid volume > 1.25 ml.kg-1, reported to represent an 'at-risk stomach' for pulmonary aspiration. We conducted a prospective, observer-blinded, randomised trial in healthy children fasted according to current pre-operative guidelines. An initial ultrasound assessment of gastric contents ensured that the stomach was empty. Children then drank a specific volume of water (0; 0.6; 1; 1.25; 1.5; or 2 ml.kg-1). Gastric ultrasound was performed after 3 min of fluid ingestion, in children lying supine and then in the right lateral decubitus position, with the head of the bed elevated to 45° (semi-recumbent). A clinical algorithm combining the qualitative assessment with calculation of gastric fluid volume was also completed. The sensitivity and specificity of the qualitative assessment in the supine semi-recumbent position and the clinical algorithm for the diagnosis of gastric fluid volume > 1.25 ml.kg-1 were estimated. Ninety children, median (IQR [range]) age 7 (4.5-9 [1-10]) y, were studied. The sensitivity and specificity of the qualitative assessment for detecting gastric fluid volume > 1.25 ml.kg-1 were 75% (95%CI 58-88%) and 85% (95%CI 73-93%), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the clinical algorithm were 86% (95%CI 71-95%) and 78% (95%CI 64-88%), respectively. In order to achieve high sensitivity of gastric ultrasound for the diagnosis of fluid volume > 1.25 ml.kg-1 in children, qualitative ultrasound assessment of gastric antrum contents should be combined with calculation of gastric fluid volume when fluid contents are seen in the gastric antrum.",

      "abstract": "Airway management for nonelective surgical procedures in the setting of trauma, pain, and opioid use can be complicated by the potential for aspiration due to delayed gastric emptying. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) remains a useful tool for evaluating gastric content and volume in various clinical settings. The authors evaluated gastric volume and content in children scheduled for urgent and semi-urgent procedures to assess their aspiration risk. After obtaining consent, gastric POCUS was performed in the preoperative holding area for pediatric patients scheduled for both elective and nonelective surgery. Qualitative and quantitative measurements of the gastric antrum were taken, and the risk of gastric aspiration was calculated. Additional data collected included patient demographics, the type of surgery, nil per os (NPO) status at the time of surgery, NPO status at the time of injury, and administration of opioids. The study cohort included 100 patients ranging in age from 3 to 17 years old (mean age 9.2 years). Out of these 100 patients, gastric scanning was successfully conducted in 98 patients. Sixteen of fifty-nine nonelective patients (27%) had received opioids for pain control prior to surgery. Among the 34 patients who had suffered an acute injury, 7 (21%) had been NPO for <8 hours at the time of the injury. Ninety-nine out of hundred patients had been NPO for at least 6 hours at the time of the gastric ultrasound. Based on our gastric ultrasound findings, all patients who were appropriately NPO had either Grade 0 or Grade 1 risk for aspiration, indicating a low risk of aspiration. The preliminary data show that when patients presenting for nonelective surgery are appropriately NPO, they may have a low risk of aspiration. This information may help guide the choice of anesthetic induction technique, particularly when concerns exist about the safety of a rapid sequence induction. It allows for a more stable and controlled induction of anesthesia.",

      "abstract": "Rational preoperative fasting can reduce the risk of regurgitation and aspiration, enhance anesthesia safety and efficiency, and mitigate the adverse effects of prolonged fasting. This study investigates the existing practices of preoperative fasting management in Chinese pediatric patients and explores the real duration of preoperative fasting. This is a cross-sectional study. A questionnaire on fasting management in children was developed and an online survey was conducted among anesthesiologists. The survey mainly included the real implementation of pediatric fasting protocols, anesthesiologists' understanding of pediatric fasting management, and the application of gastric ultrasound. Moreover, data on pediatric preoperative fasting durations were collected from different hospitals across China. A total of 770 questionnaires and 1285 records of preoperative fasting cases were obtained. The survey indicated variations in preoperative fasting protocols among hospitals. Most hospitals recommended fasting for clear fluids for 2 h, while the new 1-h regimen and the liberal regimen were less implemented due to concerns regarding regurgitation and aspiration risks. Fasting for breast milk, formula milk, and solid food was mainly based on traditional protocols, with fasting durations of 4 h, 6 h, and 8 h, respectively. Most anesthesiologists have experienced regurgitation and aspiration, but there were significant differences in their awareness of the prevention and prognosis of regurgitation and aspiration. Utilization of gastric ultrasound was limited, with a lack of equipment and familiarity among anesthesiologists. Real preoperative fasting durations for children were significantly longer than those recommended in the guidelines. Factors contributing to prolonged fasting were identified. There is a big gap between preoperative fasting practices and the guidelines, and the real fasting durations of children before surgery are significantly longer than the guideline recommendations. Anesthesiologists should strengthen their understanding of preoperative fasting management in pediatric patients, master the skills of gastric ultrasound assessment, and timely address inefficiencies in pediatric preoperative fasting management.",

Very early risk stratification of GIB patients can sometimes be a challenge. The decision to intubate these patients is multifactorial and requires careful consideration. Gastric ultrasound (GUS) is an adjunct tool that may help make such decisions and is supported by anesthesiology society guidelines to assess aspiration risk. In this manuscript, we present a case series of ED patients with upper GIB in whom emergency physicians (2 fellowship-trained attendings and 2 senior residents facile with point-of-care ultrasound) performed GUS. As a supplement to the clinical examination, this sonographic \"lavage\" (i.e., using GUS in patients with upper GIB) helped predict aspiration risk, support diagnostic reasoning, and expedite early goal-directed management and appropriate disposition. We also provide a step-by-step tutorial using high-quality media, as well as a novel algorithm for translation of this technique to the bedside for emergency physicians.",

      "abstract": "Pulmonary aspiration is a severe complication in patients receiving anesthesia for surgical procedures. The risk and severity of aspiration are significantly higher in the presence of substantial gastric contents. Bedside ultrasound imaging of the gastric antrum is emerging as a rapid and valuable method to evaluate gastric contents before surgery. Rapid gastric ultrasound using a three-category grading system promotes timely decision-making to help in emergent or urgent surgeries by identifying patients with potentially high gastric volumes or solid food contents. In emergent cases with limited time, a single ultrasound view of the gastric antrum is still likely to yield helpful information. In this report, we argue that bedside ultrasound offers a more reliable assessment of gastric contents than assumptions based on time-based fasting guidelines.",

Tertiary care teaching hospital. Adults of either gender with BMI < 40 kg/m2 with end-stage renal failure scheduled to undergo arteriovenous graft or fistula. The cross-sectional area of the gastric antrum was measured by gastric ultrasound with patient in both supine and right lateral decubitus positions. The volume of the gastric contents were calculated using suitable validated formula. In addition, the nature of the gastric contents was also determined by gastric ultrasound. The incidence of delayed gastric emptying was found to be 57.7% in the population studied despite following the prescribed preoperative standard fasting guidelines.

      "abstract": "Pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents during elective surgery remains a major cause of airway-related mortality and morbidity. The preoperative fasting times for solids and liquids have been standardized across various anesthesia society guidelines. Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) guidelines now advocate liberal clear fluid intake with carbohydrate loading up to 2 h preoperatively. The aim of the study was to assess whether practicing both ASA fasting guidelines and ERAS protocol makes the patients prone to a full stomach. The supine position standard curvilinear ultrasound probe (2-5 MHz) with Sonosite M-Turbo ©system was used to obtain the images. Gastric residual volume (GRV) was derived from the cross-sectional area (CSA) using the Perlas and colleagues model. A total of 102 patients were recruited and analyzed. The mean age and BMI were 50.65 years ± 13.35 years and 22.23 kg/m2 ± 3.7 kg/m2, respectively. A total of four patients (3.92%) had gastric volume > 1.5 ml/kg; out of these four patients, three were female and one was male. We did not observe any case of pulmonary aspiration in any of our patients. In conclusion, even though for elective surgeries, the current fasting guidelines are adequate, these findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with risk factors for high gastric residual volume where further studies need to be performed.",

      "abstract": "Pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents is a serious perioperative complication. Patients with gastric cancer may experience delayed gastric emptying. However, the role of qualitative and quantitative gastric ultrasound assessments in this patient population before anesthesia induction has not yet been determined. Adult patients with gastrointestinal cancer were recruited and examined using gastric point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) before anesthetic induction from March 2023 to August 2023 in a tertiary cancer center. Three hundred patients with gastric cancer were conducted with POCUS prior to induction, and three hundred patients with colorectal cancer were included as controls. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the gastric antrum and gastric volumes (GV) were measured and calculated. We determined the nature of the gastric contents and classified the antrum using a 3-point grading system. A ratio of GV to body weight > 1.5mL/Kg was defined as a high risk of aspiration. In patients with gastric cancer, 70 patients were classified as grade 2 (23%, including 6 patients with solid gastric contents) and 63 patients (21%) were identified as having a high risk of aspiration. Whereas in patients with colorectal cancer, only 11 patients were classified as grade 2 (3.7%), and 27 patients (9.7%) were identified as having a high risk of aspiration. A larger tumor size (OR:1.169, 95% CI 1.045-1.307, P = 0.006), tumor located in antrum (OR:2.304, 95% CI 1.169-4.539,P = 0.016), gastrointestinal obstruction (OR:21.633, 95% CI 4.199-111.443, P < 0.0001) and more lymph node metastasis (OR:2.261, 95% CI 1.062-4.812, P = 0.034) were found to be positively while tumor site at cardia (OR:0.096, 95% CI 0.019-0.464, P = 0.004) was negatively associated with high aspiration risk in patients with gastric cancer. The Gastric POCUS prior to induction provides an assessment of the status of gastric emptying and can identify the patients at high risk of aspiration, especially those with gastric cancer.

      "abstract": "The retention of gastric contents at surgery presentation is a risk factor for perioperative aspiration. A preoperative fasting (nil per os; NPO) interval is widely used to reduce this risk, but this approach is based on assumptions about the prevalence of typical gastric emptying rates. We assessed NPO guidelines' reliability with ultrasound (US) imaging and suction in pediatric patients presenting for single long-bone fracture repair after appropriate NPO intervals, when nearly all should have had empty stomachs. This prospective cross-sectional observational study comprised 200 pediatric surgical patients. As their NPO times varied by food/drink type, we defined \"weighted NPO units\" as the lowest multiple of elapsed recommended NPO times between consumption and surgery for each type of food or drink. We used US to image the stomach and its contents before anesthesia induction, followed by gastric suction. We evaluated the relationships between weighted NPO units, US gastric contents grade, opioid analgesic dosage and timing, and suctioned volume. Despite meeting typical NPO standards (median 14 h fasting), many patients retained nontrivial quantities of gastric contents at surgery. Weighted NPO units did not exhibit statistically-significant relationships with either suctioned volume or US grade. However, suctioned volume did correspond well to US grade. NPO status may be a less reliable predictor of gastric contents at anesthesia induction in this patient population than has been assumed. Bedside US screening appears to provide more useful information for the planning of airway management.",

      "abstract": "An atypical cytologic diagnosis arises from inflammation or early neoplastic process. It is commonly found in EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration/biopsy (EUS-FNA/FNB) tissue sampling of pancreatic malignancies. The aims of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic performance of EUS-FNA/FNB in patients with cytologic diagnosis of atypical cells and to develop a prediction model for malignant tumors of the pancreas in the atypical cytologic diagnostic category. Two hundred and twenty-six patients in the atypical cytologic diagnostic category were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine predictive factors for pancreatic malignancies. The final diagnoses were confirmed by repeat biopsy; surgical pathology, or clinical follow-up for at least 6 months. The atypical cytologic diagnosis using EUS-FNA/FNB was associated with an absolute risk of malignancy (82.3%). Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that older age, long axis of the mass, and increased carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) were independent risk factors for true malignant pancreatic tumors among patients in the atypical cytologic diagnostic category. The calibration curve had a slope of 0.96, and a regression coefficient (R2) of 0.91. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the validation group was 0.803. Atypical lesions of EUS-FNA/FNB have a higher risk of malignancy. Older age, the long axis of the mass, and elevated serum CA19-9 level were identified as independent risk factors for true malignant pancreatic tumors among patients in the atypical cytologic diagnostic category.",

      "abstract": "Objective: The present study aimed to use bedside ultrasound to evaluate the effects of metoclopramide on gastric motility in patients being treated for trauma in the emergency department. Methods: Fifty patients underwent an ultrasound immediately after attending the emergency department of Zhang Zhou Hospital due to trauma. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: a metoclopramide group (group M, n = 25) and a normal saline group (group S, n = 25). The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the gastric antrum was measured at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min (T = time). The gastric emptying rate (GER, GER=-AareaTn/AareaTn-30-1×100), GER/min (GER divided by the corresponding interval time), gastric content properties, Perlas grade at different time points, T120 gastric volume (GV), and GV per unit of body weight (GV/W) were evaluated. The risk of vomiting, reflux/aspiration, and type of anesthetic treatment were also evaluated. Results: The differences between the two groups in the CSA of the gastric antrum at each time point were statistically significant (p < 0.001). The CSAs of the gastric antrum in group M were lower than those in group S, and the greatest difference between the two groups occurred at T30 (p < 0.001). The differences between the two groups in GER and GER/min were also statistically significant (p < 0.001); those differences in group M were higher than those in group S, and the greatest differences between the two groups occurred at T30 (p < 0.001). There were no obvious change trends in the properties of the gastric contents and the Perlas grades in either group, and the differences between the two groups were not statistically significant (p = 0.97). The differences between the two groups in the GV and GV/W at T120 were statistically significant (p < 0.001), as was the risk of reflux and aspiration at T120 (p < 0.001). Conclusion: When metoclopramide was used in satiated emergency trauma patients, it accelerated gastric emptying within 30 min and reduced the risk of accidental reflux. However, a normal gastric emptying level was not achieved, which can be attributed to the delaying effect of trauma on gastric emptying.",

A pathological examination using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration(EUS-FNA) revealed gastrointestinal stromal tumor(GIST). The combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic approaches to neoplasia with the non-exposure technique(CLEAN-NET)was undertaken via a 2.5 cm single umbilical incision. The tumor was identified by EGD, and the scheduled dissected line was confirmed both from the mucosal and serosa side with an endoscope and laparoscope, respectively. The serosal and muscular layers were incised with an electric knife from outside the gastric wall; hypertonic saline solution was locally injected to swell the submucosal layer; partial gastric resection was performed with an automatic suture device without capsule damage. The operation time was 61 minutes, and there was blood less. The patient was discharged 6 days after the operation without complications. Histopathological findings showed GIST, 16× 14 mm, c-kit(+), CD34(+). The tumor was very low risk, as per the modified-Fletcher classification. Currently, 5 months after the operation, follow-up is underway without recurrence.",

Herein, we report the case of an 83 year-old man who presented with a solid mass in the pancreatic tail, measuring 35 mm in diameter, with cystic degeneration. EUS-TA was performed using a 22-gauge biopsy needle, with a single puncture via the stomach; however, no definitive pathological diagnosis was achieved. Due to the strong suspicion of malignancy, surgery was performed at the patient's request, and the postoperative pathological diagnosis was pancreatic adenosquamous carcinoma. One year after surgery, computed tomography revealed a string of bead-like nodules within the gastric wall. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed three submucosal, tumor-like raised lesions aligned in a row on the upper posterior wall of the gastric body. EUS detected a solid mass with cystic degeneration. Histological findings from EUS-TA specimens were consistent with those from the pancreatic resection specimen, leading to a diagnosis of NTS. Although reports of NTS have been increasing in recent years, cases of NTS occurring after only a single puncture remain extremely rare. This case clearly demonstrates that NTS can occur even after a single puncture, highlighting the importance of obtaining thorough informed consent regarding this risk prior to performing EUS-TA.",

The diagnosis of intestinal perforation following blister ingestion is often delayed because of an unreliable history and nonspecific clinical presentation. The purpose of this case report is to raise awareness about a rare but difficult diagnosis and its importance in avoiding potentially fatal events. CASE REPORT Herein, we describe successful cases of surgical and endoscopic removal after blister ingestion. The first case was that of a polymorbid 75-year-old man who presented with acute onset of abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant and epigastric regions. No indication of the cause was observed on initial computed tomography (CT). The patient developed an acute abdomen, and emergency laparotomy was performed, during which 2 small perforations were observed in the terminal ileum, and an empty tablet blister was retrieved. The second patient was a 55-year-old man who presented with a considerable lack of awareness. On the initial CT, a subdural hematoma, aspiration, and an unidentified foreign body in the stomach were observed. Gastroscopy was performed after emergency craniotomy. In addition to the initial foreign body, a second object, which had gone unnoticed on the initial CT, was found and removed from the esophagus. CONCLUSIONS With an increased risk of perforation and difficult clinical and radiological diagnoses, prophylactic measures and special awareness of high-risk patients are particularly important.",

      "abstract": "The aim of study is to evaluate the results of deployment of Percutaneous Radiological Gastrostomy (PRG), which is a good alternative to Surgical Gastrostomy (SG), with transoral approach in cases where Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) is contraindicated, difficult or unsuccessful, in patients with high risk of American Society of Anesthesiologists with four scores. In addition, we aimed to demonstrate the advantages of mushroom pull type catheters over push type gastrostomy catheters. This retrospective study included a total of 40 patients (18 females and 22 males) aged 21-92 years who underwent PRG with the antegrade transoral approach. PRG was performed by retrograde passing through the esophagus or snaring the guidewire from the stomach and taking out of the anterior abdominal wall. Patients' demographic data, indications for PRG, procedural outcomes and complications were screened and recorded. PRG was performed in 39 of 40 patients included in the study. Technical success rate was 97.5%. Procedure-dependent major complications such as death, aspiration, colon perforation, and deep abscess were not observed. Aspiration occurred in the first patient during the first feeding on the day after the procedure. Major complication rate was 2.5%. The total minor complication rate was 17.5% in 7 patients; parastomal leakage in 2 patients (5%), skin rash and infection in 3 (7.5%) patients, minor bleeding in 2 (5%) patients with oropharynx cancer, minimal bleeding from the gastrostomy catheter 1 week after the procedure in 1 (2.5%) patient. None of the cases had buried buffer. Tube functionality was preserved in all patients without any damage. Mushroom tip (pull type) gastrostomy catheter is a safe treatment method for patients requiring prolonged feeding because of wide diameter, endurance, long staying opening duration, less excessive dilatation and parastomal leakage, and no need for gastropexy. Lower cost and easier access are advantageous for mushroom tip pull type catheters compared to push type gastrostomy catheters in our country. The less invasive PRG is an alternative option in patients who are difficult to administer PEG, are at high anesthesia risk and cannot be sedated. This article is valuable in terms of its contribution to develop an alternative radiological method for the deployment of gastrostomy tubes in medical difficult patients. This method has shortened the duration of the procedure and increased the success rate in patients with difficulty in transition from the stomach to the esophagus or with difficulty in the upper gastrointestinal tract. Mushroom tip catheters can be placed successfully by radiological methods.",

      "abstract": "Perioperative pulmonary aspiration is a critical complication linked to significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in high-risk populations such as patients with diabetes, obesity, gastroparesis, or those using Glucagon-Like-Peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). Standard fasting protocols may not be appropriate for these patients, as they have increased propensity of delayed gastric emptying, hence increasing the complex of the preoperative risk assessment. Gastric ultrasound (GUS) provides a non-invasive, reliable method for assessing gastric content and volume, enabling anaesthesia professionals to make informed decisions regarding aspiration risk, airway management, and surgical scheduling. By identifying patients with elevated gastric volumes, GUS has the potential to reduce aspiration-related complications and unnecessary surgical cancellations.Despite its clear clinical benefits, the adoption of GUS in anaesthetic practice remains limited, primarily due to the technical skill required for accurate quantitative assessments. Qualitative evaluations of gastric contents are simpler for beginners, but precise volume measurements, essential for risk stratification, demand more extensive training. Recent studies demonstrate that with structured training, even novice operators can achieve high diagnostic accuracy. Artificial intelligence (AI) can further enhance GUS utility by automating volume calculations, guiding probe placement, and providing real-time feedback. These capabilities could significantly shorten the learning curve and improve consistency in risk assessment.Incorporating GUS and AI tools into anaesthesia training can overcome adoption barriers, enabling clinicians to more accurately assess aspiration risk and enhance patient safety in perioperative care.",

      "abstract": "Oral domperidone is a prokinetic drug that enhances gastric emptying, which has a positive effect in decreasing gastric residual volume (GRV), subsequently decreasing the risk of pulmonary aspiration. This study aimed to assess the effect of preoperative oral domperidone on gastric residual volume, detected by ultrasound for patients undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia. This randomized double-blinded controlled placebo trial was conducted in 40 patients who were randomly assigned to two equal groups: the domperidone group (D) ( n = 20): patients received 400 mL of apple juice as a clear fluid, two hours preoperatively, and an oral domperidone 10 mg tablet; and the placebo group (P) ( n = 20): patients received 400 mL of apple juice as a clear fluid two hours preoperatively with a placebo tablet. Gastric residual volume detected by ultrasound was the primary outcome and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) was the secondary outcome. There was no statistically significant difference in the mean gastric residual volume detected by ultrasound between groups after 1 hour ( P > 0.05). However, the mean gastric residual volume detected by ultrasound after 2 hours was statistically significantly lower with domperidone (55.95 ± 6.72 mL) than with the placebo group (70.22 ± 13.00 mL) ( P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between groups regarding PONV, with a P -value > 0.05.

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the impact of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on gastric volume and content using gastric ultrasonography in term pregnant women undergoing elective cesarean delivery. Given the increased aspiration risk in pregnant patients due to physiological changes, GDM-related gastric motility alterations may further complicate anesthetic management. A prospective observational cohort study included 60 pregnant women scheduled for elective cesarean delivery: 30 diagnosed with GDM and 30 without GDM. Gastric ultrasonography was performed in both the supine and right lateral decubitus positions to assess antral cross-sectional area (CSA), gastric volume, and content classification (Grade 0, 1, or 2). Quantitative measurements, fasting durations, demographic information, and preoperative blood glucose levels were collected and statistically analyzed. No significant differences were observed in gastric volumes between the GDM group (86.14 ± 38.43 ml) and the control group (77.89 ± 44.54 ml; p = 0.49). However, Grade 1 and Grade 2 gastric contents were significantly more prevalent in the GDM group (56.7% Grade 1, 16.7% Grade 2) compared to the control group (16.7% Grade 1, 0% Grade 2; p < 0.001). Preoperative blood glucose levels were significantly higher in the GDM group. Gastric ultrasonography is a valuable, noninvasive method for evaluating gastric content and volume in pregnant women, particularly those with GDM. The higher prevalence of residual gastric content in GDM patients indicates a potential delay in gastric emptying, which could increase perioperative aspiration risk despite adherence to standard fasting protocols. These findings highlight the need for individualized anesthetic strategies, particularly in emergency and high-risk obstetric anesthesia settings.",

      "title": "Gastric insufflation with and without an inserted gastric tube in second-generation laryngeal mask airways: A randomized controlled cross-over trial.",
      "abstract": "Second-generation laryngeal mask airways are equipped with an additional lumen for a gastric tube, with the intention to reduce the risk of aspiration by draining gastric content. However, the effect of an inserted gastric tube through the gastric channel on gastric insufflation, a substantial part of the pathomechanism of aspiration, during positive-pressure ventilation is not clear. We hypothesized, that an inserted gastric tube increases the risk of gastric insufflation. Single center, prospective, randomized-controlled cross-over trial. Tertiary academic hospital in Germany. 152 patients, ASA I-III, scheduled for general anesthesia with a laryngeal mask airway. Gastric insufflation was investigated during an incremental pressure trial up to a maximum airway pressure of 30 cmH2O and during oropharyngeal leak pressure measurement with and without an inserted gastric tube while one of two laryngeal mask airways with different cuff designs (inflatable or thermoelastic) was used. Gastric insufflation was detected with real-time ultrasound. Frequency of gastric insufflation was higher with than without inserted gastric tube during the incremental pressure trial (10.9 % (16/147) vs. 2.7 % (4/147), p = 0.009) and during oropharyngeal leak pressure measurement (16.3 % (24/147) vs. 5.4 % (8/147), p = 0.004). Risk of gastric insufflation didn't differ between the two cuff-types (p = 0.100). Flow over the open gastric channel was associated with gastric insufflation during positive-pressure ventilation (p = 0.003) and during oropharyngeal leak pressure measurement (p = 0.049). Incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was higher in patients in which gastric insufflation was detected, compared to others (17.1 % (6/35) vs. 5.4 % (6/112), p = 0.037). Placement of a gastric tube through the gastric channel of a second-generation laryngeal mask airway, independent of the cuff-type, increases the risk of gastric insufflation. Flow over the gastric channel indicate a higher risk of gastric insufflation and gastric insufflation may increase the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting.",

      "abstract": "Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is increasingly recognized as a valuable tool in obstetric anesthesia. This review synthesizes key studies and reviews published within the last 2 years on its application in clinical practice with relevant supporting literature. Handheld ultrasound-assisted neuraxial block placement modestly reduces periprocedure time compared with landmark-based techniques. Devices with integrated three-dimensional or artificial intelligence-guided software may improve first-attempt success, particularly in obese patients. Focused cardiac ultrasound has gained interest as a potential tool for predicting postspinal hypotension through predelivery inferior vena cava collapsibility assessment. POCUS is also valuable for evaluating shock and cardiovascular compromise, aiding in the diagnosis and clinical management of amniotic fluid embolism and maternal cardiomyopathy. Gastric ultrasound can be performed qualitatively, aids aspiration risk assessment, and can be used in studies evaluating drug effects on gastric contents and antral cross-sectional area. Robust training programs are essential to equip obstetric anesthesiologists with sustainable POCUS skill sets. POCUS is associated with reduced neuraxial block placement times, provides critical hemodynamic data in patients with amniotic fluid embolism and cardiomyopathy, and allows gastric content evaluation for aspiration risk assessment. Expanding structured training and research is crucial to maximizing its clinical utility.",

      "abstract": "Point-of-care gastric sonography offers an objective approach to assessing individual pulmonary aspiration risk before induction of general anaesthesia. We aimed to evaluate the potential impact of routine pre-operative gastric ultrasound on peri-operative management in a cohort of adult patients undergoing elective or emergency surgery at a single centre. According to pre-operative gastric ultrasound results, patients were classified as low risk (empty, gastric fluid volume ≤ 1.5 ml.kg-1 body weight) or high risk (solid, mixed or gastric fluid volume > 1.5 ml.kg-1 body weight) of aspiration. After sonography, examiners were asked to indicate changes in aspiration risk management (none; more conservative; more liberal) to their pre-defined anaesthetic plan and to adapt it if patient safety was at risk. We included 2003 patients, 1246 (62%) of which underwent elective and 757 (38%) emergency surgery. Among patients who underwent elective surgery, 1046/1246 (84%) had a low-risk and 178/1246 (14%) a high-risk stomach, with this being 587/757 (78%) vs. 158/757 (21%) among patients undergoing emergency surgery, respectively. Routine pre-operative gastric sonography enabled changes in anaesthetic management in 379/2003 (19%) of patients, with these being a more liberal approach in 303/2003 (15%). In patients undergoing elective surgery, pre-operative gastric sonography would have allowed a more liberal approach in 170/1246 (14%) and made a more conservative approach indicated in 52/1246 (4%), whereas in patients undergoing emergency surgery, 133/757 (18%) would have been managed more liberally and 24/757 (3%) more conservatively. We showed that pre-operative gastric ultrasound helps to identify high- and low-risk situations in patients at risk of aspiration and adds useful information to peri-operative management. Our data suggest that routine use of pre-operative gastric ultrasound may improve individualised care and potentially impact patient safety.",

      "title": "Gastric Ultrasound Assessing Gastric Emptying of Preoperative Carbohydrate Drinks: A Randomized Controlled Noninferiority Study.",
      "abstract": "Tools for the evaluation of gastric emptying have evolved over time. The purpose of this study was to show that the risk of pulmonary aspiration is not increased with carbohydrate drink, by demonstrating that the gastric antral cross-sectional area (CSA) of the NO-NPO group is either equivalent to or less than that of the NPO (nil per os) group. Sixty-four patients scheduled for elective laparoscopic benign gynecologic surgery were enrolled and randomly assigned to the NPO group (n = 32) or the NO-NPO group (n = 32). After having a regular meal until midnight before surgery, the NPO group fasted until surgery, while the NO-NPO group ingested 400 mL of a carbohydrate drink at midnight and freely up to 2 hours before anesthesia. The primary outcome was the gastric antral CSA by gastric ultrasound in right lateral decubitus position (RLDP). Noninferiority was defined as a mean difference of CSA <2.8 cm2. Secondary outcomes included CSA in supine position, gastric volume (GV), GV per weight (GV/kg), GV/kg >1.5 mL/kg, and Perlas grade. CSA in RLDP was not different between the NPO group (6.25 ± 3.79 cm2) and the NO-NPO group (6.21 ± 2.48 cm2; P = .959). The mean difference of CSA in RLDP (NO-NPO group - NPO group) was 0.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.56 to 1.64), which was within the noninferiority margin of 2.8 cm2. CSA was not different between the 2 groups (4.17 ± 2.34 cm2 in NPO group versus 4.28 ± 1.23 cm2 in NO-NPO group; P = .828). GV in NPO group (70 ± 56 mL) was not different from NO-NPO group (66 ± 36 mL; mean difference, 3.66; 95% CI, -20 to 27; P = .756). GV/kg in the NPO group (1.25 ± 1.00 mL/kg) was not different from the NO-NPO group (1.17 ± 0.67 mL/kg; P = .694). The incidence of GV/kg > 1.5 mL/kg was not different between NPO (31.3%) and NO-NPO group (21.9%; P = .768). The median (interquartile range) of the Perlas grade was 1 (0-1) in NPO group and 0.5 (0-1) in NO-NPO group (P = .871). Preoperative carbohydrates ingested up to 2 hours before anesthesia do not delay gastric emptying compared to midnight fasting, as evaluated with gastric ultrasound.",

      "title": "Unexpected reaction of \"wild-type\" gastrointestinal stromal tumor to imatinib: case report and literature review.",
      "abstract": "Most of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are driven by mutations in the KIT/PDGFRA genes and can benefit from TKIs treatment. However, a small subset of GIST (10%-15%) are called \"wild-type\" GISTs due to the lack of these mutations. Theoretically, they would not benefit from TKIs treatment and may even develop resistance. Therefore, this unexpected response may challenge inherent perceptions. Herein, we present a case of giant wild-type GIST exhibiting an unexpected response to imatinib(IM), followed by laparoscopic surgical resection. Subsequently, potential underlying mechanisms are discussed. This case describes a 57-year-old man who presented with abdominal pain for two weeks. CT revealed a massive lesion near the splenic hilum along the greater curvature of the stomach, concurrently involving the splenic hilar vessels and surrounding lymph nodes. Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy confirmed it is a mesenchymal spindle cell tumor,GIST. Due to the enormous volume and local invasion, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was initially considered. After 6 months of IM 400 mg/d, CT imaging revealed marked changes in tumor heterogeneity and a significant reduction in volume. Subsequently, laparoscopic surgical resection was performed. Postoperative pathological examination, immunohistochemistry, and genetic testing collectively confirmed it is a wild-type GIST.The patient recovered well and was discharged on the 6th day after surgery, with continued oral IM(400 mg/d) after discharge. No recurrence was observed during follow-up until the publication of this report. This unexpected response suggests that wild-type GISTs may benefit from TKIs treatment, and the potential mechanisms warrant further investigation. Additionally, true wild-type GIST may not be discerned due to current limitations of Next-Generation Sequencing(NGS). Therefore, for advanced/high-risk GIST, additional genetic analysis can be performed after negative NGS results.",

      "title": "Trauma in pregnancy: A narrative review of the current literature.",
      "abstract": "Trauma accounts for nearly half of all deaths of pregnant women. Pregnant women have distinct physiologic and anatomic characteristics which complicate their management following major trauma. This paper comprises a narrative review of the most recent literature informing the management of pregnant trauma patients. The incidence of trauma during pregnancy is 6-8%. The focus of clinical assessment must be on the mother, starting with the primary survey. During airway management, clinicians should consider early intubation if necessary and utilize gastric tubes to minimize the risk of aspiration. Pregnant women experience progesterone-mediated hyperventilation, and normal PaCO2 levels may portend imminent respiratory failure. Clinicians should utilize left lateral tilt in hypotensive pregnant women to displace the uterus off the inferior vena cava. Ultrasonography is an attractive imaging modality for pregnant women which is specific for ruling in intraabdominal hemorrhage but not sufficiently sensitive to exclude this diagnosis. Clinicians should not hesitate to order computed tomography imaging in unstable patients if there is diagnostic ambiguity. Cardiotocographic monitoring simultaneously assesses uterine contractions and fetal heart rate and should last at least 4 h for pregnant women following even minor abdominal trauma if their fetus has achieved viable gestational age (approximately 24 weeks). In the event of cardiac arrest, peri-mortem cesarean section may improve outcomes for the mother and fetus alike. Unique specific complications include uterine rupture and placental abruption, which require emergent resuscitation and obstetrics consultation for definitive management. Emergency clinicians should maintain a low threshold for transfer to a tertiary care center given correlations between even isolated and relatively minor traumatic injuries with adverse fetal and maternal outcomes. Trauma is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in pregnant women. Emergency clinicians must understand the evaluation and management of pregnant trauma patients.",

      "abstract": "In urgent situations, preoperative full stomach assessment mostly relies on clinical judgment. Our primary objective was to assess the diagnostic performance of clinical judgment for the preoperative assessment of full stomach in urgent patients compared to gastric point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS). Our secondary objective was to identify risk factors associated with PoCUS full stomach in urgent patients. We led a prospective observational study at our Hospital, between January and July 2016. Adult patients admitted for urgent surgery were eligible. Patients with altered gastric sonoanatomy, interventions reducing stomach content, impossible lateral decubitus were excluded. Clinical judgment and risk factors of full stomach were collected before gastric PoCUS measurements. Ultrasonographic full stomach was defined by solid contents or liquid volume ≥ 1.5 ml kg-1. Diagnostic performance was assessed through sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive and negative predictive value. The prevalence of clinical and PoCUS full stomach in 196 included patients was 29% and 27%, respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 42% (95% CI: 32.3-52.6%) and 79% (95% CI: 74.9-83.4%), respectively. Patients with PoCUS full stomach were clinically misdiagnosed in 55% of cases. PoCUS full stomach was associated with abdominal or gynaecological-obstetrical surgery (OR 3.6, 95% CI: 1.5-8.8, P < 0.01) but not with fasting durations. Positive solid intake after illness onset with respect to 6-h solid fasting rule was associated with PoCUS low-risk gastric content (OR 0.4, 95% CI: 0.2-0.9, P = 0.03). Clinical judgment showed poor-to-moderate performance in urgent surgical patients for the diagnosis of full stomach. Gastric PoCUS should be used to assess risk of full stomach in this population.",

      "abstract": "Gastric residual volume (GRV) has been widely used in clinical practice for a long time as an essential indicator of gastrointestinal motility and enteral nutrition tolerance. Recent studies have questioned the rationality of monitoring GRV routinely in critically ill patients. A \"one size fits all\" principle is not an optimal solution in the clinical practice of enteral nutrition in critically ill patients because of the huge heterogeneity of the intensive care unit (ICU) population. Each method of monitoring GRV has advantages and disadvantages. With the widespread clinical application of harmless monitoring technologies such as ultrasound, the gastric suctioning method maybe used less and less. The management of enteral nutrition focuses on identifying the factors and triggers of gastric retention, attempting to solve them from the perspective of prevention and elimination of high-risk factors for aspiration and analysis of pathophysiological mechanisms, eliminating all negative hindering factors, and actively promoting the concept of \"creating conditions for enteral nutrition\". As a critical nutrition management team, it is necessary to pay attention to the continuous improvement of enteral nutrition management culture and rationally use diversified management strategies, which may be more important than monitoring GRV.",

      "abstract": "Aspiration-related syndromes comprise a broad spectrum of diseases affecting the airways and lung parenchyma resulting from inadvertent entry of oropharyngeal or gastric contents into the respiratory tract. The diagnosis can be challenging given lack of self-reported symptoms and unwitnessed or silent aspiration events. Aspiration is a common finding in healthy individuals suggesting that host defenses play a critical role in the pathophysiology. In the absence of strict criterion, a high index of suspicion is necessary based on recognition of established risk factors and identification of characteristic imaging findings. Conditions predisposing to altered levels of consciousness and neuromuscular weakness can lead to dysphagia, impaired cough reflux, and subsequent aspiration. The most salient feature on imaging is the anatomic location of the abnormalities, with the superior segments of the lower lobes and posterior segments of upper lobes involved in the recumbent position, and basilar segments of lower lobes in the upright position. Acute syndromes include pneumonia, pneumonitis, and foreign body aspiration. In the more indolent form of aspiration, bronchiectasis, diffuse bronchiolitis, and interstitial lung disease can develop. A detailed understanding of associated radiographic findings for these syndromes can help to implicate aspiration as the cause for imaging abnormalities and ultimately optimize patient management.",

      "abstract": "Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) are highly susceptible to malnutrition, and while enteral nutrition via nasogastric tube is the preferred method, there is a risk of inadvertent reflux and aspiration. Therefore, clinicians have turned to nasointestinal tubes (NET) for enteral nutrition as an alternative option. But the precise localization of NET presents an ongoing challenge. We proposed an innovative approach to provide a valuable reference for clinicians involved in NET placement. Data were obtained retrospectively from the medical records of adult patients with a high risk of aspiration or gastric feeding intolerance who had a NET placed in the ICU of Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital between October 1, 2017, and October 1, 2023. The collected data were subjected to statistical analysis using SPSS and R software. There were 494 patients who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The first-pass success rate was 81.4% (n = 402). The success of a patient's initial NET placement was found to be associated with Angle SPC and Distance CP, as determined by univariate analysis (25.6 ± 16.7° vs. 41.9 ± 18.0°, P < 0.001; 40.0 ± 26.2 mm vs. 62.0 ± 31.8 mm, P < 0.001, respectively). By conducting a multivariate regression analysis, we identified a significant association between pyloric types and the success rate of placing NET (OR 29.559, 95%CI 14.084-62.038, P < 0.001). Angle SPC, Distance CP, and the type of pylorus are independently associated with successful initial placement of NET. Besides, patients with the outside type of pylorus (OP-type) exhibit a higher rate of initial placement success.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, diabetics have been considered patients with a high risk of aspiration due to having delayed gastric emptying; However, the evidence concerning residual gastric volume (GV) in fasting diabetic patients is inconsistent. This study aimed to compare the fasting GV of diabetic patients with or without dysautonomia with control patients scheduled for elective surgery using gastric ultrasound. This bicentric prospective single-blinded case-control study was conducted at 2 university hospitals in Spain. Patients aged over 18 years, classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical statuses I to III and having similar fasting statuses, were included in the study. The primary outcome was to compare the prevalence of risk stomach using the Perlas gastric content grading scale evaluated by ultrasound in the 3 groups. Secondary outcomes included the measurement of cross-sectional area (CSA) and GV in the right lateral decubitus (RLD) position, as well as the prevalence of solid gastric residue. A total of 289 patients were recruited for the study, comprising 145 diabetic patients (83 of whom had dysautonomia) and 144 patients in the control group. The percentage of patients classified as Perlas grade 2 was 13.2% in the control group, 16.1% in diabetic patients without dysautonomia, and 22.9% in diabetic patients with dysautonomia ( P = .31). Antral CSA was significantly higher in diabetic patients with dysautonomia (6.5 [4.8-8.4]) compared to the control group (5.4 [4.0-7.2]; P = .04). However, no significant differences were observed between groups in residual GV. Among diabetic patients with dysautonomia, 12% exhibited solid gastric residue, which was twice the percentage observed in diabetic patients without dysautonomia (4.8%) and 3 times higher than that in the control group (3.5%; P = .03). The presence of dysautonomia was associated with an increased odds ratio of solid gastric residue (odds ratio [OR], 3.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-8.87; P = .01) after adjusting for confounding factors. This study offers insights into the relationship between dysautonomia in patients with diabetes mellitus and the presence of full stomach, underscoring the significance of preoperative gastric ultrasound evaluation in managing perioperative risks in this population.",

The obese group included patients with body mass index (BMI) of 30 - 40 and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade II and those with BMI > 40 and ASA III without other comorbidities; the normal-weight group included patients with normal BMI and ASA I. Gastric volume was predicted in each group using sonographic measurement of antral cross-sectional area (CSA) in semi-sitting and right lateral positions (RLP); the two groups were compared to assess the risk of aspiration for each group preoperatively. Despite intergroup differences in antral CSA, the sonographically predicted gastric volume was < 1.5 mL/kg in both groups in both positions. Both groups were at a low risk for aspiration, and 98% of the patients showed grade 0 or 1 in antrum assessments, corresponding to an empty antrum and minimal fluid only in the RLP, respectively. Only 2% of the patients in both groups showed a distended antrum in both positions. Despite the differences in CSA between obese and normal-weight participants in both positions (obese > normal-weight), both groups showed a low predicted gastric residual volume < 1.5 mL/kg and were at low risk for aspiration, provided that fasting was initiated at least 8 hours before elective surgery.",

We aimed to assess the performance of the current equation used in non-pregnant adults for patients who had undergone gastric sleeve and develop a new equation for this population if necessary. Secondarily, we determined if a 2-hour fast from clear fluids is sufficient to empty the stomach in this population. 37 subjects who had undergone a gastric sleeve in the last 10 years were randomly assigned to drink 100, 200 or 300 mL of water after fasting 8 hours from solids and 2 hours from clear fluids. Pre-drink and 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min post-drink scans measured antral grade and cross-sectional area. Subjects participated in up to three study visits drinking different volumes. The existing equation was statistically suboptimal. A new equation was created with variables identified by LASSO regression (Volume (mL)=15.5×CSA (cm2)-0.28×Weight (kg)-0.75×Height (cm)+97.9) with a mean bias of <1 mL (95% limits of agreement -51.2 to 51.2 mL). After 120 min, 93.2% of post-drink scans were grade 0, and all had a calculated volume <1.5 mL/kg. The existing equation is likely still best suited for clinical use; however, the equation proposed here has superior accuracy in patients with prior gastric sleeve.

The patients were randomly allocated to receive no drink or 100 or 200 mL of water or milk. US-guided GRV was re-assessed within 5 min after the intervention. Investigators were blinded to the measurements performed by each other and to the randomisation arm. The primary outcome was the agreement between actual volumes consumed and estimated change in GRV. Agreement between actual volume consumed and estimated change in GRV was poor [Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09 to 0.72; P = 0.09 for assessor 1 and ICC 0.37; 95% CI 0.02 to 0.66; P = 0.03 for assessor 2]. US-guided GRV measurements using Perlas's formula, performed by trained anaesthesiologists may not be a reliable measure of GRV.",

      "abstract": "Gastritis cystica profunda (GCP), commonly observed in remnant gastric anastomosis, is associated with developing gastric cancer. This case report describes a patient with GCP in a previously unoperated stomach that mimicked a pyloric submucosal tumor and caused anorexia, which is rare in clinical practice. A 72-year-old woman presented with loss of appetite and weight. Gastroscopy detected a 20 mm diameter submucosal tumor near the pylorus. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging identified a cystic lesion, unlike a usual submucosal tumor in the stomach. The diagnosis was difficult, even with endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. Surgery was performed for diagnosis and treatment. The lesion was resected using a submucosal dissection technique after an incision of the gastric wall during open laparotomy. Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of GCP and revealed no dysplasia or cancer. Anorexia resolved after the surgery. Residual or recurrent lesions were not detected during follow-up examinations performed 1 year after surgery. GCP occurring in a previously unoperated stomach as a macroscopic lesion like a submucosal tumor causing some symptoms is rare. GCP is associated with a risk of developing cancer. Therefore, careful evaluation and management during treatment are required.",

      "abstract": "Although restricting food intake during labor is recommended by guidelines, intrapartum starvation has not been popular in some regions. We conducted this comparative cross-sectional study to determine the prevalence of risk stomach in non-fasted laboring women compared with fasted non-laboring women using gastric ultrasound. Ultrasound examination of the antrum was performed in 50 term fasted non-laboring women before elective cesarean delivery and 50 laboring women allowed to eat and drink during active labor. Examinations consisted of the qualitative (antral grades, 0-3) and quantitative evaluation (antral cross-sectional area and calculated gastric volume) in the supine and right lateral decubitus (RLD) position. A risk stomach was defined as an antral grade ≥ 2 or grade 1 with gastric volume ≥ 1.5 ml· kg- 1. No non-laboring women had grade ≥ 2, while 34 (68%) laboring women had grade ≥ 2. Nine (18%) non-laboring and 40 (80%) laboring women presented risk stomach (P < 0.001) (risk ratio: 4.4, 95% CI 2.4-8.2). Compared with non-laboring women, laboring women had larger antral area at \"empty\" stomach (grade 0) (437 mm2 vs.350 mm2 in supine, 571 mm2 vs.480 mm2 in RLD, P < 0.05) and cut-off values of antral area to discriminate a risk stomach (510 mm2 vs. 453 mm2 in supine, 670 mm2 vs. 605 mm2 in RLD). This study confirms a higher prevalence of risk stomach presents in laboring women under a liberal eating policy, gastric ultrasound is therefore useful for this risk population if general anesthesia is required unexpectedly.",

In addition to a 28 mm pancreatic head tumor, soft tissue shadow and fluid collection surrounding the superior mesenteric artery(SMA)due to pancreatitis were observed in the abdominal CT scan. The tumor was histologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and S-1 was performed to control the progression of the pancreatic cancer and improve the inflammatory changes for reduction of the operative risk. After 2 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, abdominal CT scan revealed stable disease according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors and attenuation of the inflammatory changes surrounding the SMA. Then, subtotal stomach- preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed without the difficulty of peeling around the SMA in spite of the old inflammatory changes. Histological examination of the resected specimen showed R0 resection. The patient was discharged 18 days after surgery without any complications and is surviving 9 months postoperatively without any recurrence. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was helpful for disease control and improvement of the inflammatory changes.",

      "title": "Gastric Point of Care Ultrasound in Adults: Image Acquisition and Interpretation.",
      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, diagnostic point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) has emerged as a rapid and non-invasive bedside tool for addressing clinical inquiries related to gastric content. One emerging concern pertains to patients about to undergo sedation and/or endotracheal intubation: the elevated risk of aspiration from the patient's stomach contents. Aspiration of gastric contents into the lungs poses a serious and potentially life-threatening complication. This occurs more frequently when the stomach is considered \"full\" and can be affected by the techniques employed for airway management, making it potentially preventable. To mitigate the risk of peri-procedural aspiration, two distinct medical specialties (anesthesiology and critical care medicine) have independently developed techniques to utilize ultrasonography for identifying patients requiring \"full stomach\" precautions. Due to these separate specialties, the work of each group remains relatively unfamiliar outside its respective field. This article presents descriptions of both techniques for gastric ultrasound. Furthermore, it explains how these approaches can complement each other when one of them falls short. Regarding image acquisition, the article covers the following topics: indications and contraindications, selection of the appropriate probe, patient positioning, and troubleshooting. The article also delves into image interpretation, complete with example images. Additionally, it demonstrates how one of the two techniques can be employed to estimate gastric fluid volume. Lastly, the article briefly discusses medical decision-making based on the findings of this examination.",

Study 1: A prospective observational study was conducted to examine the presence or absence and growth rate of tumor cells in gastric juice before and after the procedure in patients with SELs who underwent MIAB (n = 25) or EUS-FNAB (n = 22) between September 2018 and August 2021. Study 2: A retrospective study was conducted to examine the impact of MIAB on postoperative prognosis in 107 patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumors diagnosed using MIAB (n = 39) or EUS-FNAB (n = 68) who underwent surgery between January 2001 and July 2020. In study 1, although no tumor cells were observed in gastric juice in MIAB before the procedure, they were observed in 64% of patients after obtaining samples (P < 0.001). In contrast, no tumor cells were observed in the gastric juice in EUS-FNAB before and after the procedure. In study 2, there was no significant difference in 5-year disease-free survival between MIAB (100%) and EUS-FNAB (97.1%) (P = 0.27). MIAB is safe, with little impact on postoperative prognosis, although the procedure releases some tumor cells after damaging the SEL's pseudocapsule.",

Gastric ultrasonography (GUS) can be used to qualitatively differentiate between solids, liquids, and empty gastric contents. The purpose of this study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of GUS in identifying gastric contents after participants were randomly assigned to consume 1 donut, drink 360 mL of water, or remain fasted (n=60 each group). Ultrasonography was performed by a blinded scanner, and qualitative findings were recorded by 2 sonography examiners and the primary scanner. Findings from the water group included a sensitivity of 95% to 100% and specificity of 87.5% to 90% for identification of liquids. Interrater reliability results yielded an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)=.781 for the solid group; ICC=.950 for the fluid group; and ICC=.761 for the fasted group. Statistically significant differences were found for the effect that body mass index classifications had on sensitivity and specificity of GUS for predicting gastric content. Results of this study demonstrated that GUS is highly sensitive, specific, and reliable with low false-positive and false-negative rates in the identification of fluid gastric content.",

      "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and/or obesity. The physiological actions of endogenous GLP-1, and synthetic GLP-1RAs include inhibition of gastric emptying. This has peri-procedural implications due to the potential increased risk of retained gastric contents which may result in pulmonary aspiration. There is a need for local evidence-based guidelines to best manage patients on GLP-1RAs and dual GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonists (GLP-1/GIPRAs) presenting for surgical and medical procedures requiring sedation or anaesthesia. A panel of experts was formed to consider the peri-procedural implications of GLP-1RA and GLP-1/GIPRA use and establish best practice recommendations based on the current evidence.We recommend that all patients should be asked about glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) and dual GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor co-agonist (GLP-1/GIPRA) use prior to anaesthesia or sedation for surgical and endoscopic procedures and be informed of the benefits and risks. We also recommend that GLP-1RAs and GLP-1/GIPRAs be continued in the peri-procedural period. Preprocedural diet modification with a 24-h clear fluid diet, followed by standard 6-h fasting, should be recommended for all patients receiving GLP-1RAs or GLP-1/GIPRAs. In patients who have not completed or are unable to have a 24-h liquid diet, risk stratification using gastric ultrasound or minimally sedated gastroscopy to assess gastric contents is recommended, as is the use of intravenous erythromycin. We cannot currently recommend using the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms for risk stratification, nor can we recommend an adequate cessation period for GLP-1RAs and GLP-1/GIPRAs to ensure gastric emptying has returned to baseline levels. This clinical guideline, developed by multiple professional bodies, outlines current best practice recommendations for patients taking GLP-1RAs and combined GLP-1/GIPRAs who require general anaesthesia, sedation and/or endoscopic procedures. The guide provides a structure for Australian and New Zealand primary health practitioners, gastroenterologists, surgeons, endocrinologists, anaesthetists and perioperative physicians to support clinical decisions in these patients.",

We evaluated the incidence of a full stomach by ultrasound assessment of the gastric volume in children with cerebral palsy who underwent orthopedic surgery after preoperative fasting.

We obtained the gastric antral cross-sectional area using ultrasound in the semi-recumbent and right lateral decubitus positions. A calculated stomach volume > 1.5 mL.kg-1 was considered as full, which poses a high aspiration risk. The primary outcome was the incidence of full stomach, and the secondary outcomes were the qualitative gastric volume, correlation of disease severity categorized according to the Gross Motor Function Classification System with the residual gastric volume, gastric volume per body weight, and qualitative gastric volume. Thirty-seven pediatric patients with cerebral palsy, scheduled for elective orthopedic surgery, were included for analysis. Full-stomach status was observed in none, and the gastric volume per body weight was 0.5 (0.4-0.7) mL.kg-1. No significant differences were observed in the residual gastric volume (p = 0.114), gastric volume per body weight (p = 0.117), or qualitative grade of gastric volume (p = 0.642) in relation to disease severities. Children with cerebral palsy who fasted preoperatively had empty or nearly empty stomachs. Further studies are required to determine the optimal fasting duration for such children.",

      "abstract": "Cricoid pressure has been used as a component of the rapid sequence induction and intubation technique. However, concerns have been raised regarding the effectiveness and safety of cricoid pressure. Paratracheal pressure, a potential alternative to cricoid pressure to prevent regurgitation of gastric contents or aspiration, has been studied to be more effective to cricoid pressure in preventing gastric insufflation during positive pressure ventilation. However, to adopt paratracheal compression into our practice, adverse effects including its effect on the glottic view during direct laryngoscopy should be studied. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial comparing paratracheal and cricoid pressures for any adverse effects on the view during direct laryngoscopy, together with other secondary outcome measures. In total, 140 adult patients undergoing general anesthesia randomly received paratracheal pressure (paratracheal group) or cricoid pressure (cricoid group) during anesthesia induction. The primary end point was the incidence of deteriorated laryngoscopic view, evaluated by modified Cormack-Lehane grade with a predefined noninferiority margin of 15%. Secondary end points included percentage of glottic opening score, ease of mask ventilation, change in ventilation volume and peak inspiratory pressure during mechanical mask ventilation, ease of tracheal intubation, and resistance encountered while advancing the tube into the glottis. The position of the esophagus was assessed by ultrasound in both groups to determine whether pressure applied to the respective area would be likely to result in esophageal compression. All secondary outcomes were tested for superiority, except percentage of glottic opening score, which was tested for noninferiority. Paratracheal pressure was noninferior to cricoid pressure regarding the incidence of deterioration of modified Cormack-Lehane grade (0% vs 2.9%; absolute risk difference, -2.9%; 95% confidence interval, -9.9 to 2.6, P <.0001). Mask ventilation, measured on an ordinal scale, was found to be easier (ie, more likely to have a lower score) with paratracheal pressure than with cricoid pressure (OR, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.79; P = .008). The increase in peak inspiratory pressure was significantly less in the paratracheal group than in the cricoid group during mechanical mask ventilation (median [min, max], 0 [-1, 1] vs 0 [-1, 23]; P = .001). The differences in other secondary outcomes were nonsignificant between the groups. The anatomical position of the esophagus was more suitable for compression in the paratracheal region, compared to the cricoid cartilage region. Paratracheal pressure was noninferior to cricoid pressure with respect to the effect on glottic view during direct laryngoscopy.",

This study aimed to evaluate the proportion of such children with high-risk gastric contents using preoperative gastric ultrasound. Prospective observational cohort study. Specialist pediatric center over a 30-month period. Children undergoing surgery within 24 h of an acute extremity fracture. None. According to preoperative qualitative and quantitative ultrasound analysis of the antrum in the supine and right lateral decubitus positions, gastric contents were classified as high-risk (clear liquid with calculated gastric fluid volume > 0.8 mL.kg-1, thick liquid, or solid) or low-risk. Factors associated with high-risk gastric contents were identified by multivariable analysis. Forty-one children (37%; 95% CI: 28-47) of the 110 studied (mean(SD) age: 10(3) years) presented with high-risk gastric contents, including 26 (24%; 95% CI: 16-33) with solids/thick liquid contents. Scanning in the supine position alone allowed a diagnosis of high-risk gastric contents in 23 children out of the 63 for whom right lateral decubitus positioning was unfeasible. Gastric contents remained undetermined in 41 children, including one with a non-contributory gastric US (antrum non-visualized). Proximal limb fractures (OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.0-6.2), preoperative administration of opioids (OR: 3.9; 95% CI: 1.1-13), and the absence of bowel sounds (OR: 8.0; 95% CI: 1.4-44) were associated with high-risk gastric contents. Performing surgery the day following the trauma was a protective factor (OR: 0.1; 95% CI: 0.0-0.6). No cases of pulmonary aspiration occurred. At least one-third of children with an acute isolated extremity fracture had preoperative gastric contents identified as high risk for pulmonary aspiration. Although preoperative history can guide anesthetic strategy in this population, ultrasound allowed clear stratification of the risk of aspiration in most cases.",

      "abstract": "Aspiration of gastric contents during induction of general anesthesia remains a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in anesthesia. Recent data show that pulmonary aspiration still accounts for many cases with implications on mortality despite technical and technological evolution. Practical, ethical, and methodological issues prevent high-quality research in the setting of aspiration and rapid sequence induction/intubation, and significant controversy is ongoing. Patients' position, drugs choice, dosing and timing, use of cricoid force, and a reliable risk assessment are widely debated with significant questions still unanswered. We focus our discussion on three approaches to promote a better understanding of rapid sequence induction/intubation and airway management decision-making. Firstly, we review how we can use qualitative and quantitative assessment of fasting status and gastric content with the point-of-care ultrasound as an integral part of preoperative evaluation and planning. Secondly, we propose using imaging-based mathematical models to study different patient positions and aspiration mechanisms, including identifying aspiration triggers. Thirdly, we promote the development of a global data collection system aiming to obtain precise epidemiological data. Therefore, we fill the gap between evidence-based medicine and experts' opinion through easily accessible and diffused computer-based databases. A better understanding of aspiration epidemiology obtained through focused global data gathering systems, the widespread use of ultrasound-based prandial status evaluation, and development of advanced mathematical models might potentially guide safer airway management decision making in the 21st century.",

      "title": "Ultrasonographic Evaluation of Gastric Content and Volume in Pediatric Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery: A Prospective Observational Study.",
      "abstract": "Anesthesia-related complications, such as pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, occur in approximately 0.02-0.1% of elective pediatric surgeries. Aspiration risk can be reliably assessed by ultrasound examination of the gastric antrum, making it an essential non-invasive bedside tool. In this prospective observational study, since most of our patients are immigrants and have communication problems, we wanted to investigate gastric contents and the occurrence of \"high risk stomach\" in children undergoing elective surgery for the possibility of pulmonary aspiration, even if the children and/or parents reported their last oral intake time. This risk is defined by ultrasound findings of solid content in the antrum and/or a calculated gastric volume exceeding 1.25 mL/kg. Children aged 2-18 were included in the study. Both supine and right lateral decubitus (RLD) ultrasound examinations were performed on the antrum before surgery. Using a qualitative grading scale from 0 to 2, we evaluated the gastric fluid content. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of the antrum was measured in the RLD position, aiding the calculation of the gastric fluid volume according to an established formula by Perlas. Ultrasound measurements of 97 children were evaluated. The median fasting duration was 4 h for liquids and 9 h for thick liquids and solids. Solid content was absent in all the children. Five children (5.2%) exhibited a grade 2 antrum, implying that fluid content was visible in both the supine and RLD positions. The median antral CSA in the RLD was 2.36 cm2, with a median gastric volume of 0.46 mL/kg. For patients with a grade 0 antrum, a moderate and positive correlation was observed between the antral CSA and BMI, and a strong and positive correlation was evident between the antral CSA and age, similar to a grade 1 antrum. Only a single child (1%) had a potentially elevated risk of aspiration of gastric contents. Hence, the occurrence of a \"high risk stomach\" was 1% (95% confidence interval: 0.1-4.7%) and is consistent with the literature. As a necessary precaution, we propose the regular use of ultrasound evaluations of gastric contents, given their non-invasive, bedside-friendly, and straightforward implementation, for identifying risks when fasting times are uncertain and for ruling out unknown risk factors in each potential patient.",

From June 2020 to February 2021, a total of 80 patients, aged 18-65 years, body mass index (BMI) 18-35 kg/m2, falling into American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status Ⅰ or Ⅱ, scheduled for gynecological laparoscopic procedures positioning in trendelenburg were recruited and divided into two groups: the observation group (n =40) and the control group (n=40). In the observation group, solid food was restricted after 24:00, the patients were required to take 300 mL carbohydrates two hours before surgery. In the control group, solid food and liquid intake were restricted after 24:00 the night before surgery. The cross-sectional area (CSA) of gastric antrum was measured in supine position and right lateral decubitus position before anesthesia. Primary outcome was gastric volume (GV) in each group. Secondary outcome included Perlas A semi-quantitative grading and gastric volume/weight (GV/W). All the patients received assessment of preoperative feeling of thirsty and hunger with visual analogue scale (VAS). Complete data were available in eighty patients. GV was (58.8±23.6) mL in the intervention group vs. (56.3±22.1) mL in the control group, GV/W was (0.97±0.39) mL/kg vs. (0.95±0.35) mL/kg, respectively; all the above showed no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Perlas A semi-quantitative grading showed 0 in 24 patients (60%), 1 in 15 patients (37.5%), 2 in 1 patient (2.5%) in the intervention group and 0 in 25 (62.5%), 1 in 13 (32.5%), 2 in 2 (5%) in the control group, the proportion of Perlas A semi-quantitative grading showed no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). A total of 3 patients (1 in the intervention group and 2 in the control group) with Perlas A semi-quantitative grading 2 were treated with special intervention, no aspiration case was observed in this study. The observation group endured less thirst and hunger (P＜0.05). Three hundred mL carbohydrates intake two hours before surgery along with ultrasound guided gastric content monitoring does not increase gastric volume and the risk of reflux aspiration in patients positioning in trendelenburg undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery, and is helpful in minimizing disturbance to the patient's physiological needs, therefore leading to better clinical outcome.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to compare gastric ultrasound assessments between young and elderly patients, to determine whether the cross-section area (CSA) cutoff values for elderly and young patients should be different, and to suggest CSA cutoff values for elderly patients. This study evaluated the data of 120 patients who underwent elective surgery under general anesthesia between July 2019 and August 2020. Demographic and gastric ultrasound assessment data were retrieved. Patients were divided into the elderly group (n = 58, age: ≥65 years) and young group (n = 62, age: <65 years). The CSAs in the supine and right lateral decubitus positions (RLDP), semiquantitative 3-point Perlas grade (grades 0, 1, and 2), and gastric volume (GV) were determined. CSAs according to different Perlas grades were compared between the 2 groups. To compare normally and non-normally distributed continuous data, Student t test and the Mann-Whitney U test were used, respectively. Categorical data were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were built for the CSAs to predict pulmonary aspiration. The CSA cutoff values for predicting a high risk of pulmonary aspiration in both the groups were determined. Among patients with Perlas grade 0, the CSAsupine (P = .002) and CSARLDP (P = .002) were greater in the elderly group than in the young group. The specificity, positive predictive value, and accuracy of the CSA decreased when the CSA cutoff value for the young group was applied to the elderly group. The CSA cutoff values for the elderly group were: CSAsupine, 6.92 cm2 and CSARLDP, 10.65 cm2. The CSA of the empty stomach was greater in elderly patients than in young patients. We suggest that the following CSA cutoff values should be used for predicting pulmonary aspiration risk in elderly patients: CSAsupine, 6.92 cm2 and CSARLDP, 10.65 cm2.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Despite standard preoperative fasting guidelines, residual gastric content can persist in some patients, increasing the risk of aspiration pneumonitis. Multiple patient-specific factors may predict gastric content retention, but their predictive accuracy is limited. We hypothesized that ultrasound would more reliably identify residual gastric content compared to a comprehensive questionnaire and aimed to determine the most practical approach for risk assessment in elective surgical patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational study in adult patients scheduled for elective surgery at a single center. All participants adhered to an 8 h fasting period. The primary outcome was the incidence of a \"full stomach\" on ultrasound. Secondary outcomes included the Perlas risk classification, comparisons of established volume estimation formulas, correlations with self-reported fasting duration, agreement between questionnaire-based predictions and ultrasound findings, and the time efficiency of each method. Multivariable logistic regression and Cohen's kappa were used for analyses. Results: Data from 404 patients were analyzed. Despite prolonged fasting, 16.3% had a full stomach by ultrasound, suggesting incomplete gastric emptying. Early satiety and cholelithiasis significantly predicted a full stomach; prolonged fasting duration and female sex were protective. Questionnaire-based predictions demonstrated fair agreement with ultrasound (kappa = 0.327). The Michiko formula often yielded negative volumes, highlighting limitations in volume estimations. Ultrasound examination (3 min median) was faster than questionnaire completion (5 min). Conclusions: Ultrasound accurately detects residual gastric content, outperforming questionnaire-based assessments. Integrating it into routine preoperative evaluation may improve patient safety, although research is needed to refine volume estimation formulas and expand feasibility for patients with positioning limitations.",

      "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are mesenchymal tumors and have some malignant potential. Mitotic count is important for predicting the malignant potential of GISTs. Proper treatment of GISTs requires accurate pathological diagnosis. In general, endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration and deep biopsy are used for pathological diagnosis of GIST before making decisions about surgery. This study sought to evaluate the pathological uniformity of gastric GISTs for mitotic index of the center and periphery of the GIST. We retrospectively reviewed the data of 37 gastric GIST patients who underwent wedge resection at Hanyang University Hospital. We used Armed Forces Institute of Pathology criteria to classify gastric GISTs. To determine the pathological uniformity of gastric GISTs, we compared GIST risk stratification between the center and periphery of GISTs. The mean size of GISTs was 3.56 ± 2.10 cm. Three lesions were located in the antrum, 11 in the fundus, 9 in the cardia, and 14 in the body. The mean age of patients was 58.65 ± 9.44 years; 18 patients were male and 19 were female. Thirty-five patients (94.6%) showed the same level of risk stratification between the center and periphery of gastric GISTs, while two patients (5.4%) presented different levels of risk between the two sites. No significant difference in mitotic count was observed between the two sites (kappa value = 0.863; p = 0.001). Mitotic index category (either more than five mitoses per high-power field or five or fewer mitoses per high-power field) of GISTs showed good concurrence between the center and periphery.",

      "abstract": "Aspiration pneumonitis is an inflammatory disease of the lungs which is difficult to diagnose accurately. Large-volume aspiration of oropharyngeal or gastric contents is essential for the development of aspiration pneumonitis. The role of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea is often underestimated as a rare etiological factor for aspiration in the diagnosis process of aspiration pneumonitis. We present a case of a patient with 4 weeks of right-sided watery rhinorrhea accompanied by intermittent postnasal drip and dry cough as the main symptoms. Combined with clinical symptoms, imaging examination of the sinuses, and laboratory examination of nasal secretions, she was initially diagnosed as spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with CSF rhinorrhea, and intraoperative endoscopic findings and postoperative pathology also confirmed this diagnosis. Her chest computed tomography showed multiple flocculent ground glass density shadows in both lungs on admission. The patient underwent endoscopic resection of meningoencephalocele and repair of skull base defect after she was ruled out of viral pneumonitis. Symptoms of rhinorrhea and dry cough disappeared, and pneumonitis was improved 1 week after surgery and cured 2 months after surgery. Persistent CSF rhinorrhea caused by spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele was eventually found to be a major etiology for aspiration pneumonitis although the absence of typical symptoms and well-defined risk factors for aspiration, such as dysphagia, impaired cough reflex and reflux diseases. We report a rare case of aspiration pneumonitis caused by spontaneous sphenoid sinus meningoencephalocele with CSF rhinorrhea, which can bring more attention and understanding to the uncommon etiology for aspiration, so as to make more accurate diagnosis of the disease and early surgical treatment.",

Four patterns were identified. \"Controllers\" had normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) without M. tuberculosis growth in bronchoalveolar lavage or gastric aspirate (BAL/GA). \"Early subclinicals\" showed transient ESR elevation and/or M. tuberculosis growth on BAL/GA for 60 days postinfection, \"mid subclinicals\" were positive for 90 days, and \"late subclinicals\" were positive intermittently, despite the absence of clinical disease. Variability was noted regarding granuloma formation, lung/lymph node metabolic activity, lung/lymph node bacterial burden, gross pathology, and extrapulmonary disease. Like human M. tuberculosis infection, this highlights the heterogeneity associated with the establishment of latent infection, underscoring the need to understand the clinical spectrum and risk factors associated with severe disease.",

      "abstract": "Polytrauma patients are at a higher risk of delayed gastric emptying. To assess the gastric volume, a reliable diagnostic tool is needed to prevent the occurrence of aspiration pneumonia, which remains a serious complication associated with anesthesia. Gastric antral ultrasound can provide reliable information about the size of the gastric antrum in traumatized patients undergoing emergency surgery. A prospective observational study of 45 polytrauma patients undergoing emergency surgery under general anesthesia was carried out. Prior to induction of anesthesia in the emergency department, gastric ultrasound was performed for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the gastric antrum in a supine position and right lateral decubitus (RLD) position. This was followed by routine placement of the nasogastric tube to aspirate and calculate the volume of the stomach contents. Of the 45 polytrauma patients, the risk assessment of aspiration and the anesthesia technique changed in 14 patients (31.1%) after the gastric ultrasound examination. A very good relationship existed between the expected stomach volume at the RLD position and the suction volume in the nasogastric tube. In all cases, no aspirations were documented. Ultrasound examination of the stomach in polytrauma patients allows assessing the size and type of stomach contents. The data obtained can influence the choice of anesthesia technique and reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov . registry number: NCT04083677 on September 6, 2019.",

      "abstract": "The role of preoperative pharmacological prophylaxis in preventing aspiration pneumonitis under general anesthesia (GA) in patients at low risk of aspiration pneumonitis is still under debate. We addressed the need for routine pharmacological aspiration prophylaxis in at-risk population by assessing the change in gastric volume using ultrasound with and without pharmacological acid aspiration prophylaxis. A single-center, randomized double-blinded trial, with 200 adult patients scheduled for elective surgical procedures under GA, were randomized into a prophylaxis group, in which the patients received oral famotidine and metoclopramide, and a no prophylaxis group, in which the patients did not receive any prophylaxis. Gastric volume derived from preinduction measurement of gastric antral volume by ultrasound, postinduction gastric pH, and incidences of aspiration pneumonitis were compared. Bland-Altman plot was used to determine the level of agreement between measured gastric volume and ultrasonography based on calculated gastric volume. The gastric antral cross-sectional area (CSA) and volume in the no prophylaxis group (3.12 cm2 and 20.11 ml, respectively) were comparable to the prophylaxis group (2.56 cm2 and 19.67 ml, respectively) (P-values 0.97 and 0.63, respectively). Although there was a statistically significant decrease in gastric pH in the no prophylaxis group (P-value 0.01), it was not clinically significant to increase the risk of aspiration pneumonitis based on Roberts and Shirley criteria (P-value 0.39). In an adequately fasted low-risk population, the amount of residual gastric volume was similar and below the aspiration threshold, regardless of the aspiration prophylaxis status.",

      "abstract": "Background/Objectives: Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have transformed the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. However, their sustained effect on delaying gastric emptying raises new challenges in gastrointestinal endoscopy performed under sedation. This narrative review aims to summarize current evidence on the impact of GLP-1 RAs on gastric motility and to propose clinical strategies to mitigate associated procedural risks. Methods: A narrative review was conducted integrating findings from scintigraphy, capsule endoscopy, gastric ultrasound, and existing clinical guidelines. Emphasis was placed on studies reporting residual gastric content (RGC), anesthetic safety outcomes, and procedural feasibility in patients undergoing endoscopy while treated with GLP-1 RAs. Results: GLP-1 RAs significantly increase the prevalence of clinically relevant RGC, despite prolonged fasting, with potential implications for airway protection and sedation safety. Although the risk of pulmonary aspiration remains low (≤0.15%), procedural delays, modifications, or cancellations can occur in up to 30% of cases without adapted protocols. Several professional societies (AGA, ASGE, AASLD) advocate for individualized management based on procedure type, symptomatology, treatment phase, and point-of-care gastric ultrasound (POCUS), in contrast to the systematic discontinuation recommended by the ASA. Conclusions: Effective management requires personalized fasting protocols, risk-based stratification, tailored anesthetic approaches, and interprofessional coordination. We propose a clinical decision algorithm and highlight the need for training in gastrointestinal pharmacology, POCUS, and airway management for endoscopists. Future priorities include prospective validation of clinical algorithms, safety outcome studies, and the development of intersocietal consensus guidelines.",

      "abstract": "Preoperative gastric ultrasound allows non-invasive qualitative and quantitative assessment of gastric contents aiding in preoperative risk assessment. We hypothesized that appropriately fasted diabetic surgical patients taking GLP-1 agonists would have higher gastric volumes than those not taking GLP-1 agonists. This prospective, observational cohort study enrolled diabetic patients undergoing elective surgery, comparing those taking (n = 106) and not taking (n = 100) GLP-1 agonists. The primary outcome was gastric volume assessed via gastric ultrasound in the right lateral decubitus position. Secondary outcomes included presence of a full stomach (solids/thick liquids or greater than 1.5 mL/kg clear liquid), need for surgery delay, Perlas grade, and occurrence of intraoperative aspiration. The impact of GLP-1 agonist type, duration of use, and timing of last dose on gastric volume was also examined. Diabetic patients on GLP-1 agonists had significantly higher median gastric volumes compared to patients not on GLP-1 agonists (0.61 mL/kg vs 0.16 mL/kg, P < 0.001) and increased odds of a full stomach (OR 11.3, 95 % CI 5.2-24.7, P < 0.0001). GLP-1 agonist use correlated with higher Perlas grades (P < 0.001). Gastric volumes were significantly higher with GLP-1 agonist use within 7 days of surgery relative to use within 7-14 days or more than 14 days from surgery (P < 0.001 for both comparisons). GLP-1 agonist therapy was associated with higher residual gastric volumes and higher risks of full stomachs in fasted diabetic patients. GLP-1 agonist use within 7 days of surgery was also associated with higher gastric volumes relative to holding therapy for over 7 days, supporting current consensus-based guidelines.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies have indicated that point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) of the gastric antrum can predict the adequacy of fasting before surgery and anesthesia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utility of gastric POCUS in patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy procedures. We performed a single-center cohort study in patients undergoing upper GI endoscopy. Consenting patient's gastric antrum was scanned before anesthetic care for endoscopy to determine the cross-sectional area (CSA) and qualitatively determine safe and unsafe contents. Further, an estimate of residual gastric volume was determined using the formula and the nomogram methods. Subsequently, gastric secretions aspirated during endoscopy were quantified and further correlated with nomogram and formula-based assessments. No patient required a change in the primary anesthetic plan except for using rapid sequence induction in those with unsafe contents on POCUS scans. Qualitative ultrasound measurements consistently determined safe and unsafe gastric residual contents in 83 patients enrolled in the study. Unsafe contents were determined by qualitative scans in 4 out of 83 cases (5%) despite adequate fasting status. Quantitatively, only a moderate correlation was demonstrated between measured gastric volumes and nomogram (r = .40, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.57; P = .0002) or formula-based (r = .38, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.55; P = .0004) determinations of residual gastric volumes. In daily clinical practice, qualitative POCUS determination of residual gastric content is a feasible and useful technique to identify patients at risk of aspiration before upper GI endoscopy procedures.",

Principally, pulmonary aspiration can occur at any stage of anesthesia. In the clinical routine the aim must therefore be to identify those patients who have an increased risk of aspiration. When this is successful, measures can be taken to reduce the risk; these can be regional anaesthesia or the performance of general anaesthesia as rapid sequence induction (RSI). If severe pulmonary aspiration occurs despite all preventive measures, mostly during induction of anaesthesia, extensive experience and rapid action are necessary. This can only be achieved if the induction to RSI is performed by three persons with supervision of the trainee anaesthetist by a consultant anaesthetist.",

      "abstract": "Cumulative energy/protein deficit is associated with impaired outcomes in pediatric intensive care Units (PICU). Enteral nutrition is the preferred mode, but its delivery may be compromised by periods of feeding interruptions around procedures, with peri-extubation fasting the most common procedure. Currently, there is no evidence to guide the duration of the peri-extubation fasting in PICU. Therefore, we aimed to explore current PICU fasting practices around the time of extubation and the rationales supporting them. A cross sectional electronic survey was disseminated via the European Pediatric Intensive Care Society (ESPNIC) membership. Experienced senior nurses, dieticians or doctors were invited to complete the survey on behalf of their unit, and to describe their practice on PICU fasting prior to and after extubation. We received responses from 122 PICUs internationally, mostly from Europe. The survey confirmed that fasting practices are often extrapolated from guidelines for fasting prior to elective anesthesia. However, there were striking differences in the duration of fasting times, with some units not fasting at all (in patients considered to be low risk), while others withheld feeding for all patients. Fasting following extubation also showed large variations in practice: 46 (38%) and 26 (21%) of PICUs withheld oral and gastric/jejunal nutrition more than 5 h, respectively, and 45 (37%) started oral feeding based on child demand. The risk of vomiting/aspiration and reducing nutritional deficit were the main reasons for fasting children [78 (64%)] or reducing fasting times [57 (47%)] respectively. This variability in practices suggests that shorter fasting times might be safe. Shortening the duration of unnecessary fasting, as well as accelerating the extubation process could potentially be achieved by using other methods of assessing gastric emptiness, such as gastric point of care ultrasonography (POCUS). Yet only half of the units were aware of this technique, and very few used it.",

      "abstract": "Semaglutide is a long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist known to delay gastric emptying. Despite a growing body of evidence, its peri-operative safety profile remains uncertain, particularly with regard to the risk of increased residual gastric content and aspiration of gastric contents during anaesthesia. We hypothesised that semaglutide interruption of ≤ 10 days before elective surgical procedures is insufficient to reduce or normalise the residual gastric content, despite fasting intervals that comply with current guidelines. In this prospective observational study, we recruited patients who received pre-operative once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide within 10 days of the procedure (semaglutide group) and control patients who had not been exposed to semaglutide (non-semaglutide group). On the day of surgery, all patients underwent pre-operative point-of-care gastric ultrasound to evaluate their residual gastric content. Increased residual gastric content was defined as any solid content or > 1.5 ml.kg-1 of clear fluids as assessed by gastric ultrasound. We recruited 220 patients, 107 in the semaglutide group and 113 in the non-semaglutide group. Increased residual gastric content was found in 43/107 patients (40%) in the semaglutide group and 3/113 (3%) in the non-semaglutide group (p < 0.001). In propensity-weighted analysis, semaglutide use (OR 36.97, 95%CI 16.54-99.32), age (OR 0.95, 95%CI 0.93-0.98) and male sex (OR 2.28, 95%CI 1.29-4.06) were significantly associated with increased residual gastric content. There were no cases of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. Pre-operative semaglutide use within 10 days of elective surgical procedures was independently associated with increased risk of residual gastric content on pre-operative gastric ultrasound assessment.",

Patients with either 1/ an absence of visualised gastric content (qualitative evaluation) or 2/ a gastric volume < 1.5 mll/kg in case of clear fluid gastric content (quantitative evaluation) were classified as having an empty stomach. In our study, twenty-six (26%) patients had a full stomach at the time of extubation. The incidence of full stomach was not significantly different between patients who fasted < 6 h or patients who fasted ≥ 6 h. Among the 57 patients receiving enteral nutrition (EN) within the last 48 h, there was no correlation between the duration of EN interruption and the GAA. The absence of EN was not associated with an empty stomach. At the time of extubation, the incidence of full stomach was high and not associated with the fasting characteristics (duration/absence of EN). Our results support the notions that fasting before airway management procedures is not a universal paradigm and that gastric ultrasound might represent a useful tool in the tailoring process.

      "abstract": "Though the role of fasting preoperative gastric ultrasound has been validated in different patient populations, namely, obese, pregnant and diabetics, it has not been explored in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This prospective, observational study compared the fasting sonological assessment of gastric contents in patients with CKD versus those with normal renal function scheduled for elective surgery. After ethical approval and trial registration were obtained, preoperative gastric ultrasound was done in 115 CKD patients and 115 with normal renal function. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of residual gastric volume was done. Also, the patients were administered the Porto Alegre Dyspeptic Symptoms Questionnaire (PADYQ) to evaluate gastroparesis objectively. The researcher was not blinded to the patient groups. Data analyses were done using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Windows software (version 22.0). Gastric volumes exceeding 1.5 ml/kg or particulate or solid contents were found in 57 patients with CKD and 36 patients with normal renal function (P = 0.004). The PADYQ scores were 6.54 ± 8.49 for CKD and 2.15 ± 5.71 for normal renal function (P < 0.0001) groups. CKD patients had a higher age (P < 0.001), lower body mass index (P = 0.005) and higher incidence of diabetes mellitus (P < 0.001). There were no incidents of gastric aspiration. Renal dysfunction contributes to delayed gastric emptying. PADYQ can also help identify those at high risk of gastroparesis. Combining the questionnaire and preoperative gastric ultrasound must be considered in these patients to ensure optimum safety.",

      "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have become increasingly popular as both diabetic and weight loss therapies. One effect of this class of medication is delayed gastric emptying, which may impact the risk of aspiration during anesthesia delivery. In this prospective study, we used gastric ultrasound to evaluate the presence of solid gastric contents in both supine and lateral positions after an eight-hour fast in those taking GLP-1RA compared with controls. Participants underwent a second ultrasound evaluation two hours later after drinking 12 fluid ounces of water (approximately 350 mL). Twenty adults voluntarily enrolled, giving a total of ten participants in each group. In the supine position, 70% of semaglutide participants and 10% of control participants had solids present on gastric ultrasound (risk ratio [RR], 3.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26 to 9.65; P = 0.02.) In the lateral position, 90% of semaglutide participants and 20% of control participants had solids identified on gastric ultrasound (RR, 7.36; 95% CI, 1.13 to 47.7; P = 0.005). Two hours after drinking clear liquids, the two groups did not differ in the lateral position, but in the supine position, 90% of control group participants were rated as empty compared with only 30% of semaglutide group participants (P = 0.02). This study provides preliminary evidence that GLP-1RAs may affect gastric emptying and residual gastric contents following an overnight fast and two hours after clear liquids, which may have implications for aspiration risk during anesthetic care.",

      "abstract": "Esophageal screening is a valuable inclusion in videofluoroscopic swallowing studies (VFSSs). However, routine standardized esophageal screening does not always occur in clinical practice. This study introduced and evaluated an esophageal screening protocol at one Australian hospital. Radiology, gastroenterology, and speech-language pathology endorsed an esophageal screening protocol, which followed a timed 20-ml International Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative Level 0 bolus from mouth to stomach in an upright anterior-posterior position. Measures exploring clinical impacts and barriers were recorded. Participants were compared with 100 consecutive VFSS patients prior to the introduction of the esophageal screening protocol. During the esophageal screening protocol trial, 163 VFSSs were conducted with recruited patients. Aspiration risk (29%, n = 47/163) and positioning limitation (3%, n = 5/163) were barriers to esophageal screening. Rates of esophageal screening significantly increased with the esophageal screening protocol (χ2 = 63.462, p < .001). There was no difference in radiation dose for patients who had esophageal screening and those who did not in the esophageal screening protocol group (U = 1689.000, p = .237). The VFSS team breached the esophageal screening protocol for some patients, when evaluating esophageal transit time (n = 28) and recommending gastroenterology referral (n = 6). There was no difference between groups for rates of gastroenterology consults (χ2 = 1.805, p = .188) or dysphagia procedures (χ2 = 1.951, p = .209). This study confirms that routine esophageal screening provides additional clinical information to assist holistic dysphagia management without adverse operational impacts. Further research with the multidisciplinary dysphagia team has commenced to continue to optimize and refine esophageal screening practice.",

      "abstract": "The physiology of diabetes mellitus can increase the risk of perioperative aspiration, but there is limited and contradictory evidence on the incidence of \"full stomach\" in fasting diabetic patients. The aim of this study is to assess the baseline gastric content (using gastric ultrasound) in diabetic and nondiabetic patients scheduled for elective surgery who have followed standard preoperative fasting instructions. This was a prospective, noninferiority study of 180 patients (84 diabetic and 96 nondiabetic patients). Bedside ultrasound was used for qualitative and quantitative assessment of the gastric antrum in the supine and right lateral decubitus positions. Fasting gastric volume was estimated based on the cross-sectional area of the gastric antrum and a validated model. The hypothesis was that diabetic patients would not have a higher baseline fasting gastric volume compared to nondiabetic patients, with a noninferiority margin of 0.4 ml/kg. Secondary aims included the comparison of the incidence of full stomach (solid content or more than 1.5 mL/kg of clear fluid), estimation of the 95th percentile of the gastric volume distribution in both groups, and examination of the association between gastric volume, glycemic control, and diabetic comorbidities. The baseline gastric volume was not higher in diabetic patients (0.81 ± 0.61 ml/kg) compared to nondiabetic patients (0.87 ± 0.53 ml/kg) with a mean difference of -0.07 ml/kg (95% CI, -0.24 to 0.10 ml/kg). A total of 13 (15.5%) diabetic and 11 (11.5%) nondiabetic patients presented more than 1.5 ml/kg of gastric volume (95% CI for difference, -7.1 to 15.2%). There was little correlation between the gastric volume and either the time since diagnosis or HbA1C. The data suggest that the baseline gastric volume in diabetic patients who have followed standard fasting instructions is not higher than that in nondiabetic patients.",

      "abstract": "To investigate the effect of gastric antrum ultrasonography in evaluating gastric emptying after oral administration of 300 mL carbohydrates two hours before cesarean section, and to analyze the risk factors of gastric emptying in pregnant women. From August 2020 to February 2021, a total of 80 patients, aged 22-43 years, body mass index (BMI) < 35 kg/m2, gestational age≥36 weeks, falling into American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status Ⅰ or Ⅱ, scheduled for cesarean sections in Peking University International Hospital were recruited and divided into two groups: the intervention group (n=40)and the control group (n=40). In the intervention group, solid food was restricted after 22:00, the patients were required to take 300 mL carbohydrates two hours before cesarean section. In the control group, solid food and liquid intake were restricted after 22:00 the night before surgery. All the patients received assessment of preoperative feeling of thirst and starvation with visual analogue scale (VAS). The cross-sectional area (CSA)of gastric antrum was measured in supine position and right supine position before anesthesia, the gastric volume (GV)and the gastric volume/weight(GV/W)of the two groups was further calculated. Perlas A semi-quantitative grading assessments were performed in each patient. The blood pressure and heart rate were recorded at admission(T0), 5 minutes after anesthesia (T1), immediately after fetal delivery (T2) and at the end of the surgery (T3). The occurrence of nausea and vomiting during the operation and 24 hours after the operation were recorded. One case in each group was excluded because the antrum was not clearly identified during the ultrasound assessments. In the semi-sitting position, the CSA was (5.07±1.73) cm2 in the intervention group vs. (5.24±1.96) cm2 in the control group, respectively; in the right lateral decubitus position, CSA was (7.32±2.17) cm2 in the intervention group vs. (7.25±2.24) cm2 in the control group, GV was (91.74±32.34) mL vs. (90.07±31.68) mL, GV/W was (1.27±0.40) mL/kg vs. (1.22±0.41) mL/kg, respectively; all the above showed no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). Perlas A semi-quantitative grading showed 0 in 20 patients (51.3%), 1 in 16 (41%), 2 in 3 (7.7%)in the intervention group and 0 in 22 (56.4%), 1 in 15 (38.5%), 2 in 2 (5.1%)in the control group, the proportion of Perlas A semi-quantitative grading showed no significant difference between the two groups (P > 0.05). For the patients with Perlas A semi-quantitative grade 2 (3 cases in the intervention group and 2 cases in the control group), metoclopramide 0.2 mg/kg was intravenously injected before anesthesia. No aspiration case was observed in this study. The intervention group was endured less thirst and hunger (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in blood pressure and heart rate between the two groups at each time point (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of intraoperative hypotension between the two groups (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of nausea intraoperatively and postoperatively between the two groups (P > 0.05). Ultrasonography of gastric antrum can provide objective basis for evaluating gastric emptying of pregnant women perioperatively. 300 mL carbohydrates intake two hours before surgery, which does not increase GV and the risk of reflux aspiration, and is helpful in minimizing disturbance to the patient's physiological status, therefore leading to better clinical outcome.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the gastric fluid volume (GFV) in children who fasted 1 versus 2 hours using ultrasound, after ingestion of a defined volume of clear fluid. Children scheduled for elective surgery were enrolled in this randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial. After receiving 3 mL kg -1 clear fluid, participants were randomized to have a gastric ultrasound after fasting for either 1 hour (1-hour group, n = 116) or 2 hours (2-hour group, n = 111). Our primary outcome was the GFV. Other outcomes included the antral cross-sectional area, frequency of high risk and low risk of aspiration, and qualitative grading for the gastric antrum. Two hundred and twenty-seven children were available for final analysis. The median (Q1-Q3) GFV was higher in the 1-hour group versus the 2-hour group (0.61 [0.41-0.9] mL kg -1 vs 0.32 [0.23-0.47] mL kg -1 ; P value = .001). None of the study groups had GFV ≥1.5 mL kg -1 . The frequency (%) of GFV ≥1.25 mL kg -1 was comparable between both groups (2 [1.7%] vs 0 [0%], P value = .165). However, the frequency of GFV ≥0.8 mL kg -1 was higher in 1-hour group than in 2-hour group (34.5% vs 4.5%), and grade 2 antral grading score was 56.9% in 1-hour group vs 0.9% in 2-hour group ( P value <.001). In healthy children scheduled for elective surgery receiving 3 mL kg -1 clear fluid, the median GFV after 1-hour fasting was double the volume after conventional 2-hour fasting. These findings should be considered whether weighting the risk/benefit of a liberal approach to preoperative fasting versus the risk of pulmonary aspiration.",

      "abstract": "Delayed gastric emptying increases the risk of pulmonary aspiration during anaesthesia for Caesarean delivery. Our aim in conducting this narrative review was to consider the effect of pregnancy on gastric emptying. The indices of gastric emptying after liquids, solids, or both and when fasted in the various trimesters of pregnancy, at the time of Caesarean delivery, in labour, and the postpartum period were assessed. We considered 32 observational studies, one nonrandomised controlled study, and 22 randomised controlled trials. The evidence indicates that, compared with the nonpregnant state, gastric emptying is decreased in the first but not the second and third trimesters. Before elective Caesarean delivery, carbohydrate drink or tea with milk leads to no difference in gastric cross-sectional area at 2 h relative to fasting or water. Following a standard fast for elective Caesarean delivery, patients may still have high-risk gastric contents. Compared with the nonpregnant state and third trimester, gastric emptying is delayed in labour, although the choice of analgesia has modifying effects. Systemic opioids delay gastric emptying. Epidural analgesia increases gastric emptying, but not back to baseline. Intrathecal analgesia delays gastric emptying relative to epidural analgesia. Women in labour who have eaten solids in the last 8 h still have high-risk gastric contents present in the stomach. The evidence with respect to the postpartum period is conflicting. In conclusion, inconsistencies in the literature reflect the unpredictability of gastric emptying in pregnancy and underline the potential value of gastric ultrasound in women who are pregnant.",

      "abstract": "We investigated factors affecting the low- and high-risk groups for aspiration by measuring gastric volume with ultrasound in diabetic patients who fasted for elective surgery. The study was conducted as an observational study. Sixty-five patients scheduled for elective surgery, aged 18-86 years, with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores II-III, and who have diabetes were included after local ethics committee approval. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Demographic data of cases were recorded. Patients whose gastric residual volume (GRV) was calculated using the pupils equal, round, reactive to light, and accommodation (PERLA) formula following gastric antrum measurement in the right lateral decubitus and supine position by ultrasound were categorized as low or high risk for aspiration. Thirty-one patients were in the low-risk group, and 34 patients were in the high-risk group. Sex, weight, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) values, and duration of diabetes were not statistically significant (p > 0.5). Age (p = 0.006) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) (p = 0.005) were statistically significant. The risk of aspiration decreases with age. Hyperglycemia is related to delayed gastric emptying and a high risk for aspiration. The duration of fasting, GRV, and cross-sectional area (CSA) were statistically significant (p = 0.017, p = 0.000, and p = 0.000, respectively). Gastric emptying might be delayed in diabetic patients resulting in a high risk for aspiration pneumonia. The risk of aspiration increases in young diabetic patients, and preoperative FBG measurements can provide an idea about gastric emptying in diabetic patients. Gastric ultrasound (USG) may contribute to guidelines for determining more appropriate fasting times for other patient populations, such as obese, pregnant, or child patients.",

      "abstract": "Today, preoperative fasting guidelines have changed, allowing clear liquid intake up to 1 h before surgery. However, concerns remain regarding the risk of aspiration associated with clear liquid intake. This study aimed to investigate the impact of clear fluid given 1 h before surgery on child anxiety and gastric volumes. A prospective, randomized, controlled study included 90 patients aged 5-12 years. The patients were randomly allocated into three groups by a computer-generated randomization: group F (n = 30): standard fasting group, group W (n = 30): patients who received oral water at a dose of 5 mL/kg 1 h before surgery, group C (n = 30): patients who received oral carbohydrate fluid at a dose of 5 mL/kg 1 h before surgery. All patients were assessed using the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (m-YPAS) before and 1 h after fluid administration. Antral cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured with ultrasonography after intubation, and gastric residual volume (GRV) was calculated. Hemodynamic data, blood sugar level, and parental satisfaction were also recorded. The m-YPAS scores obtained after 1 h were significantly lower in group C than in the other groups (p &lt; 0.001). Antral CSA and GRV values were lower in group C and group W than in the fasting group (p &lt; 0.001). Parental satisfaction was highest in group C. This study suggests that allowing a carbohydrate-rich clear liquid intake 1 h before surgery can significantly reduce preoperative anxiety in pediatric patients without increasing the risk of aspiration.",

Gastric duplication cysts (GDCs) are uncommon in adults, and most cases are discovered incidentally. Here, we report a fortuitous discovery of a rare case of an asymptomatic noncommunicating GDC in an adult revealed after an endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration of a suspected mucinous cystadenoma of the pancreas. A 34-year-old female presented with renal colic. Her abdominal examination was normal. She presented a cystic image at the left lumbar discovered fortuitously during ultrasonography. On uro-computed tomography, there was a suspicion of a pancreatic cystadenoma. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pancreas suggested a mucinous cystadenoma of the pancreatic tail. The endoscopic ultrasound showed a cystic thick-walled formation in the tail of the pancreas. After guided fine-needle aspiration, a split aspect of the gastric wall appeared evoking a GDC. The cytology showed epithelial cells without mucin. Three years later, the patient does not have any gastrointestinal symptoms. GDCs are a rare anomaly, and accurate diagnosis of these cysts is difficult. Surgical resection can offer a definitive diagnosis. The mainstay of treatment is surgery to avoid the risk of malignancy.",

There is currently a lack of high-quality data regarding the safety of GLP-1 RAs in patients undergoing surgery, which has led to variations in practice. We performed an internet search of society-endorsed statements and guidelines related to perioperative management of GLP-1 RAs, focusing on the top 20 countries with the largest anesthesiology societies determined by membership data from the World Federation of Societies of Anesthesiologists. We excluded articles and websites that were not in English. Our search revealed endorsed statements from fourteen major anesthesiology, endocrinology, and gastroenterology societies. There was considerable variation between societies in the recommendations and guidance for withholding these medications before surgery, the duration of withholding, assessment of the need for avoiding deep sedation or general anesthesia, use of rapid sequence intubation, need for prolonged fasting periods and clear fluid before a nil per os period, recognition of signs and symptoms for aspiration risk, the management of glucose in the perioperative period, and the use of point-of-care ultrasound for risk assessment. Society-endorsed statements and guidelines provide varying recommendations on the perioperative management of GLP-1 RAs. The insights gained from this comparative analysis may help guide clinical practice, develop institutional practice guidelines, and direct future research efforts.",

This study aims to investigate the role of ultrasound in predicting the gastric volume accurately. 176 patients who underwent upper gastric endoscopy after 12-hour fasting were examined by gastric US. The patients were ran- domly divided into 6 groups according to the volume of ingested semifluid meal: (1) empty stomach (no volume), (2) 50 mL, (3) 100 mL, (4) 200 mL, (5) 300 mL, and (6) 400 mL. Antral cross-sectional area (CSA) was measured by US after each ingestion. We found a strong linear correlation between antral CSA and gastric volume up to 200 mL. The diagnostic performance of ultra- sound was found to be more powerful in the supine position than in the right lateral position. A new mathematical model was established to predict gastric volume. The threshold value for antral cross-sectional area at risk of pulmonary aspiration was determined as 3.1 cm2 by sonographic measurement. Ultrasonography could be preferred to gastric endoscopy or scintigraphy in terms of non-invasiveness and easiness, although it still merits further investigation.",

Studies regarding factors associated with the EUS-GE outcomes are limited. A retrospective observational study was conducted with consecutive patients who underwent EUS-GE for MGOO from January 2016 to November 2023. Primary outcomes were technical success (establishing EUS-GE) and clinical success (low-residue diet tolerance without re-intervention at 90-day follow-up). Secondary outcomes were adverse events (AEs), reinterventions, and full regular diet tolerance. Technical success and clinical success rates were 92.70% (127 of 137) and 88.00%, respectively, with 42.86% of the patients tolerating a regular diet. Patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis had lower odds of technical success (odds ratio [OR], .19; 95% confidence interval [CI], .04-.93). Obstruction at the level of stomach, compared with duodenum, had lower odds of clinical success (OR, .06; 95% CI, .006-.56). AE and reintervention rates were 14.17% and 8.66%. Nasogastric tube decompression before EUS-GE was associated with lower AE rates in multivariable analysis (OR, .32; 95% CI, .11-.95). Prior GI surgery was associated with reintervention in multivariable analysis (OR, 4.09; 95% CI, 1.02-16.45; P = .047). EUS-GE has high technical and clinical success rates, with many patients tolerating a regular diet. Routine nasogastric tube decompression should be considered to minimize AEs. MGOO at the level of the stomach is associated with lower clinical success rates. Extra care should be taken while performing EUS-GE in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Prior GI surgery is a likely risk factor for reintervention.",

The authors present a case of regurgitation in a patient with apparently low risk for delayed gastric emptying who drank a carbohydrate solution two hours before induction of anaesthesia. An 80-year-old male patient with a relevant history of ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, stage 3 chronic kidney disease and hypertension, was diagnosed with rectal cancer. He was scheduled for an anterior rectal resection hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery under the ERAS program, which included a 200 mL carbohydrate drink the night before and in the morning of the surgery, no less than two hours before the induction of anaesthesia. Immediately after loss of consciousness, there was regurgitation of a significant amount of clear fluid. Even though ingestion of oral carbohydrate drinks is considered to be safe up to two hours before anaesthesia, further evaluation (e.g., gastric ultrasonography) may be considered in non-high-risk patients.",

      "abstract": "We aimed to assess the accuracy of ultrasonographic measurement of the antral cross-sectional area (CSA) in the preprocedural evaluation of gastric contents and volume in fasted patients > 60 yr of age scheduled for gastroscopy under sedation. We included n = 81 patients > 60 yr of age and n = 79 younger controls scheduled to undergo elective gastroscopy in a prospective cohort study. A gastric ultrasound examination was performed to measure the antral CSA in both semisitting and right lateral decubitus (RLD) positions. Afterward, patients were graded using the Perlas qualitative grading scale. The actual gastric volume was endoscopically suctioned. Full stomach was defined as gastric volume > 1.5 mL·kg-1 and/or the presence of solid particles. We constructed receiver operating characteristic curves to determine the accuracy of ultrasonographic measurement of RLD CSA to detect a gastric volume > 1.5 mL·kg-1 and calculated the diagnostic test attributes of RLD CSA for the identification of a gastric volume > 1.5 mL·kg-1 RESULTS: The incidence of full stomach was 8/81 (9.8%) in patients > 60 yr of age and 1/79 (1.2%) in young patients (risk difference, 8.6%; 95% CI, 1.3 to 15.8; P = 0.03). The cut-off value of RLD CSA was 10.4 cm2 for the detection of gastric volume > 1.5 mL·kg-1 in patients > 60 yr of age, with a sensitivity of 75%, a specificity of 100%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 98.6%. Patients > 60 yr of age scheduled for gastroscopy under sedation had a higher incidence of a full stomach detected with ultrasound compared with a younger cohort, which is potentially associated with a higher aspiration risk. We calculated a cut-off value of RLD CSA for detecting gastric volume in patients > 60 yr of age of approximately 10 cm2, which may help to quickly assess patients at risk of aspiration. www.chictr.org.cn (ChiCTR2100048994); registered 19 July 2021.",

The aim was to assess the gastric antrum in term parturients scheduled for elective caesarean section using bedside USG. After obtaining institutional ethics committee approval and written informed consent, 250 term parturients (≥36 weeks gestational age) with body mass index 18.5-30 kg/m2, and scheduled for elective caesarean delivery were included in this study. The parturients were instructed to follow standard fasting guidelines. In the preoperative area, ultrasonographic examinations were performed 15 min before the scheduled time of the caesarean section. The primary outcome was the qualitative assessment (grade 0-2) of the gastric antrum, and the secondary outcome was the quantitative assessment (antral cross-sectional area [CSA]) of gastric antrum in supine and right lateral decubitus (RLD) position. Data analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences Software (version 19). Among the 234 parturients who completed the study, 191 exhibited grade 0 antrum, 42 had grade 1 antrum, and one parturient had grade 2 antrum. Overall, 83% of participants had an antral CSA ≤4.25 cm2 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.52-5.67 cm2] in the RLD position, equivalent to an estimated gastric volume of ≤43 ml (95% CI, 32-68 mL) or ≤1.5 ml/kg (95% CI, 0.49-1.23 ml/kg). Majority of fasted term parturients scheduled for elective caesarean section had a grade 1 gastric antrum on bedside USG.

      "abstract": "Delayed bowel function (DBF) and postoperative ileus (POI) are common gastrointestinal complications after surgery. There is no reliable imaging study to help diagnose these complications, forcing clinicians to rely solely on patient history and physical exam. Gastric point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is a simple bedside imaging technique to evaluate gastric contents but has not been evaluated in postoperative patients. Twenty colorectal patients were enrolled in this pilot study. Patients were categorized as either full or empty stomach based upon their postoperative day one gastric POCUS exams and previously published definitions. The primary outcome was GI-3 recovery, a dual end point defined as tolerance of solid food and either flatus or bowel movement. Secondary outcomes were length of stay, emesis, time to first flatus, time to first bowel movement, nasogastric tube placement, aspiration events, and mortality. Nine of 20 patients had a full stomach postoperatively. Patients with full stomachs were younger and received greater perioperative opioid doses (74.0 ± 28.2 v 42.6 ± 32.9 morphine equivalents, P = 0.0363) compared to empty stomach patients. GI-3 recovery occurred significantly later for patients with postoperative day 1 full stomachs (2.1 ± 0.4 versus 1 ± 0 days, P = 0.00091). Based upon this pilot study, gastric POCUS may hold promise as a noninvasive and simple bedside modality to potentially help identify colorectal patients at risk for postoperative DBF and POI and should be evaluated in a larger study.",

      "abstract": "Gastric contents may contribute to patients' aspiration during anesthesia. Ultrasound can accurately assess the risk of gastric contents in patients undergoing sedative gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIE) procedures, but its efficiency is limited. Therefore, developing an accurate and efficient model to predict gastric contents in outpatients undergoing elective sedative GIE procedures is greatly desirable. This study retrospectively analyzed 1501 patients undergoing sedative GIE procedures. Gastric contents were observed under direct gastroscopic vision and suctioned through the endoscope. High-risk gastric contents were defined as having solid content or liquid volume > 25 ml and pH < 2.5; otherwise, they were considered low-risk gastric contents. Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis were used to select the independent risk factors to predict high-risk gastric contents. Based on the selected independent risk factors, we assigned values to each independent risk factor and established a novel nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was verified in the testing cohort by the metrics of discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. In addition, an online accessible web calculator was constructed. We found BMI, cerebral infarction, cirrhosis, male, age, diabetes, and gastroesophageal reflux disease were risk factors for gastric contents. The AUROCs were 0.911 and 0.864 in the development and testing cohort, respectively. Moreover, the nomogram showed good calibration ability. Decision curve analysis and Clinical impact curve demonstrated that the predictive nomogram was clinically useful. The website of the nomogram was https://medication.shinyapps.io/dynnomapp/. This study demonstrates that clinical variables can be combined with algorithmic techniques to predict gastric contents in outpatients. Nomogram was constructed from routine variables, and the web calculator had excellent clinical applicability to assess the risk of gastric contents accurately and efficiently in outpatients, assist anesthesiologists in assessment and identify the most appropriate patients for ultrasound.",

It is typically associated with vascular or pancreatic pathologies, including pancreatic cysts, tumors, or pseudoaneurysms involving adjacent arteries such as the splenic or gastric artery. A 68-year-old male patient was evaluated for a pancreatic tail cyst detected on magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). The lesion was described as a 20-mm multilocular cystic formation with septations, raising suspicion of malignancy. HP was diagnosed following an episode of gastrointestinal bleeding after endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of the pancreatic tail cystic lesion. The patient underwent EUS-FNA via a transgastric approach to obtain a tissue sample for further evaluation. The procedure was complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding and later confirmed to be HP. The bleeding was managed conservatively, and the patient remained hemodynamically stable with spontaneous resolution of symptoms. This case underscores a rare but significant complication of EUS-FNA. Given the limited number of reported cases, further research is needed to establish the incidence, risk factors, and preventive measures for HP in similar clinical scenarios.",

      "abstract": "To assess the risk of aspiration, nutrient tolerance, and gastric emptying of patients in ICUs, gastric ultrasound can provide information about the gastric contents. Using established formulas, the gastric residual volume (GRV) can be calculated in a standardized way by measuring the gastric antrum. The purpose of this study was to determine the GRV in a cohort of enterally fed patients using a miniaturized ultrasound device to achieve knowledge about feasibility and the GRV over time during the ICU stay. The findings could contribute to the optimization of enteral nutrition (EN) therapy. A total of 217 ultrasound examinations with 3 measurements each (651 measurements in total) were performed twice daily (morning and evening) in a longitudinal observational study on 18 patients with EN in the interdisciplinary surgical ICU of Saarland University Medical Center. The measured values of the GRV were analyzed in relation to the clinical course, the nutrition, and other parameters. Measurements could be performed without interrupting the flow of clinical care and without pausing EN. The GRV was significantly larger with sparsely auscultated bowel sounds than with normal and excited bowel sounds (p < 0.01). Furthermore, a significantly larger GRV was present when using a high-caloric/low-protein nutritional product compared to an isocaloric product (p = 0.02). The GRV at the morning and evening measurements showed no circadian rhythm. When comparing the first and last ultrasound examination of each patient, there was a tendency towards an increased GRV (p = 0.07). The GRV measured by miniaturized ultrasound devices can provide important information about ICU patients without restricting treatment procedures in the ICU. Measurements are possible while EN therapy is ongoing. Further studies are needed to establish gastric ultrasound as a management tool in nutrition therapy.",

      "abstract": "The last two decades have provided far more options f both patients and their physicians in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. While dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have been approved for nearly two decades, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) are relatively new. Of interest to perioperative physicians, these drugs present specific perioperative concerns, prompting many societies to issue guidelines. Retained gastric contents due to slow gastric emptying is a significant drawback of GLP-1RAs, increasing the risk of aspiration. Recommendations include withholding GLP-1RAs for a predefined period of time, performing gastric ultrasound to evaluate gastric contents, modifying anesthesia management, particularly with regard to the airway, or canceling the scheduled (elective) surgery or procedure. SGLT-2is are known to increase the risk of euglycemic ketoacidosis. The benefits of both GLP-1RAs and SGLT-2is extend beyond the treatment of diabetes. As a result, perioperative physicians may encounter their use outside of their traditional indications. SGLT-2is are being used extensively to treat heart failure and obesity, for example. There have been other developments as well. For instance, Imeglimin, a variant of metformin available in Japan and India, Icodec, a once-weekly basal insulin formulation, and IcoSema, a once-weekly combination of Icodec plus semaglutide, are all being explored, although in their early stages or facing approval challenges.",

Criteria for diagnosis of aerophagia in dogs are >1/3 of bolus volume containing air or ingested air resulting in gastric distention (>1/3 of end gastric volume). Aerophagia is highlighted during eating and drinking. Videofluoroscopic swallow studies (VFSS) document aerophagia in dogs, but the incidence, clinical signs (CS), and associated disorders are unknown. Identify the incidence of aerophagia, compare CS between dogs with and without aerophagia, and identify associated and predisposing disorders using VFSS. A total of 120 client-owned dogs. Sequential VFSS and associated medical records from dogs presenting to veterinary teaching hospitals at Auburn University and the University of Missouri were retrospectively reviewed. Statistical comparisons were made using Mann-Whitney and chi-squared tests, odds ratios (OR), and multiple logistic regression (P < .05). The incidence (95% confidence interval [CI]) of aerophagia was 40% (31.7-48.9). Dogs with mixed CS (gastrointestinal [GI] and respiratory; P < .001, 58.3%) were more likely to have aerophagia than dogs with exclusively respiratory CS (25%). Aerophagia was significantly more common in brachycephalic dogs (P = .01; 45.8% vs 13.8%), dogs with nonbrachycephalic upper airway obstruction (P < .001; 33.3% vs 4.1%), pathologic penetration and aspiration (P-A) scores (P = .04; 41.6% vs 23.6%), and gagging (P < .001; 25% vs 11.7%). Mixed CS (P = .01), brachycephaly (P < .001), and upper airway obstruction (P < .001) were independent predictors of aerophagia. Aerophagia was common, particularly in dogs with mixed CS. Brachycephalic dogs and dogs with upper airway obstruction are predisposed. Aspiration risk was high, emphasizing overlapping upper aerodigestive pathways.",

      "abstract": "I have attentively read the article \"Minute Zero: an essential assessment in peri-operative ultrasound for anaesthesia\" by Elena Segura-Grau et al. [1]. The authors have suggested using point-of-care ultrasonography (POCUS) as part of a comprehensive anaesthetic assessment in the perioperative period. Such an extension of the standard perioperative examination aimed at searching for pathologies that may affect the intra- and postoperative course performed by an anaes-thesiologist seems fully justified and may have a significant impact on treatment outcomes [2]. In the \"Minute Zero\" model, the authors have suggested that POCUS assessment of anaesthetised patients should be carried out twice - on admission to the operating theatre and before transfer to the postoperative ward. The described scheme is based on the well-known eFAST, FATE and BLUE protocols (assessment to determine the presence of free fluid in the body cavities, basic cardiac assessment, including IVC, and lung ultrasound assessment). The examination conducted in the manner specified by the authors provides a general but holistic picture of the patient, focused at detecting life-threatening pathologies. It is right to include a preoperative assessment of the filling of the stomach in the protocol, as the surface area of the pylorus found on ultrasound scans indicates the risk of aspiration during the induction of general anaesthesia [3, 4]. This may be of particular importance in patients undergoing emergency procedures, with gastrointestinal obstruction or in those with difficult contact (mainly children and the elderly). In the algorithm described, the assessment of bladder filling in the postoperative period has been emphasised. This is a huge asset, which is often overlooked and, as the authors rightly point out, can cause postoperative delirium, especially in the elderly. The authors have developed an examination card that enables to document the examination in a simple and transparent manner based on markings of the appropriate blanks, which makes the protocol very friendly. The additional pros of the publication are the attached sample ultrasound images, which perfectly illustrate the ease of diagnosis of basic pathologies.",

      "title": "Gastric ultrasound to assess the prokinetic efficacy of erythromycin in a patient taking glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists.",
      "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists slow gastric emptying and may increase aspiration risk. Recent guidelines suggest using prokinetic agents pre-operatively, but no studies have assessed the efficacy of erythromycin for this purpose. We present a 53-year-old man (weight 110 kg) taking liraglutide and undergoing elective knee arthroscopy. Despite 19 h of fasting and withholding liraglutide, gastric ultrasound revealed a grade 3 antrum with solid content. Intravenous erythromycin 300 mg was administered, causing transient gastrointestinal symptoms. A repeat ultrasound 15 min later showed reduced solid content, although the antrum was not convincingly empty. As the patient declined neuraxial anaesthesia without sedation, a modified rapid sequence induction was performed. An ultrasound scan at the completion of surgery confirmed an empty stomach, and recovery was uneventful. This is the first documented case using gastric ultrasound to assess the effect of erythromycin on a patient taking a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. While erythromycin achieved its desired effect within 100 min, the optimal timing for prokinetic administration and subsequent ultrasound assessment remains uncertain. Gastric ultrasound may refine risk stratification and guide prokinetic use for these patients. Further research is needed to determine optimal erythromycin dosing, time to desired effect and side effects to optimise peri-operative management.",

      "abstract": "We hypothesized that the preoperative administration of oral erythromycin and metoclopramide would reduce the risk of high gastric volume and contents, evaluated by bedside gastric ultrasonography in non-laboring pregnant subjects preparing for elective cesarean delivery. This randomized double-blinded study included 150 parturients undergoing elective cesarean delivery. They received flavored water with oral erythromycin 400 mg (group E), oral metoclopramide 10 mg (group M), or placebo (group C) after standard meal ingestion, followed by ultrasonography measurement of gastric volume before and hourly after drug administration. The primary outcome was the mean gastric volume after six hours of fasting. Secondary outcomes included measuring gastric contents hourly until a safe level and assessing aspiration risk. Significant differences in mean (±SD) gastric volume (mL/kg) were observed after six hours among groups C, E, and M, with values of 1.05 ± 0.49, 0.71 ± 0.46, and 0.75 ± 0.48, respectively (P < 0.001). Six hours after ingesting a standard meal, low-risk gastric contents were observed in 42 parturients (84%) in Group E, 41 parturients (82%) in Group M, and 31 parturients (62%) in Group C (P = 0.017). At both the fifth- and sixth-hours post-ingestion, parturients in Groups E and M demonstrated a significantly higher gastric emptying fraction compared to Group C. Additionally, parturients in Groups E and M exhibited the shortest half-time gastric emptying and gastric emptying time. Premedication with oral erythromycin or metoclopramide before elective cesarean delivery accelerated gastric emptying and may reduce aspiration risk after a standard meal.",

      "abstract": "Gastric emptying may be delayed in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). However, the incidence of full stomach in fasting patients with DM and their risk of pulmonary aspiration under anaesthesia is not well understood. A scoping review was undertaken to map the literature on aspiration risk in DM. A search was conducted in seven bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE and Embase, for original articles that studied aspiration risk, gastric emptying, or gastric content and volume. Selection and characterisation were performed by two independent reviewers using a predefined protocol registered externally. The search identified 5063 unique records, and 16 studies (totalling 775 patients with DM) were selected: nine studied gastric emptying and seven studied gastric content or volume. There were no studies reporting the incidence of aspiration in subjects with DM. All nine studies reported delayed emptying in patients with DM compared with healthy controls. Amongst the seven studies that compared gastric residual content/volume (GRV) in the perioperative period, five reported clinically negligible GRV in both patients with DM and controls, whereas two observed a higher incidence of 'full' stomach in patients with DM. The evidence concerning the aspiration risk for surgical patients with DM is based on a limited number of studies, mostly unblinded, reporting physiological data on gastric emptying and gastric volume as surrogate markers of aspiration risk. Data on fasting gastric content and volume in patients with DM are limited and contradictory; hence, the true risk of aspiration in fasting patients with DM is unknown.",

However, there is a risk of seeding due to traction seeding. 79-year-old male. A contrast-enhanced CT scan revealed a tumor at the pancreatic tail, and EUS-FNA was performed, and a histopathological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma was made. After 2 courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, distal pancreatectomy was performed. The pathological diagnosis was intermediate-differentiated adenocarcinoma, ypT3, N0, M0, ypStage ⅡA. Two years after surgery, a blood test showed an increase in CEA level. PET-CT scan showed an abnormal accumulation near the pancreatic margin on the dorsal gastric side, and he was diagnosed as having a local recurrence and started chemotherapy(GEM+nab-PTX). After 10 courses of chemotherapy, PET-CT scan showed an abnormal accumulation only in the posterior wall of the stomach as before treatment. A partial gastrectomy was performed for the diagnosis of gastric wall metastasis by needle tract seeding(NTS). Histopathological examination revealed a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma in the submucosal and serosal layers of the gastric wall, mainly in the intrinsic layer. Six months after reoperation, the patient had no recurrence. EUS-FNA in pancreatic body tail lesions should be performed with caution against disseminated recurrence due to NTS because the puncture site is not included in the resection area.",

      "abstract": "Preoperative fasting aims to reduce the risk of pulmonary aspiration. Our aim was to compare the incidence of increased gastric content after preoperative liberal versus a standard fasting in children. Two hundred children, presented for elective surgeries, were instructed to follow either 6-4-2 (standard group) or 6-4-0 (liberal group) preoperative fasting regimens. Preoperative ultrasound was used to evaluate gastric contents. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with an \"at-risk stomach.\" Secondary outcomes included qualitative and quantitative gastric assessment, last meal, actual fasting duration, regurgitation, vomiting, aspiration incidence, surgery cancellation rate, and complications of prolonged fasting (e.g., hunger). The actual fasting duration was significantly longer than prescribed in each group (p < 0.001 for both groups) and was significantly longer in the standard group (CI95%: 0.744-2.016, medium effect size η2 = 0.068). In the liberal group, 3% of patients had an \"at-risk stomach,\" and 2% of cases were canceled. Qualitative gastric assessment was comparable between the two groups (OR 1.536, CI95%: 0.883-2.670, low effect size Cramer V = 0.139). However, the estimated gastric volume/weight ratio was significantly increased in the standard group (CI95%: 0.114-0.214; large effect size η2 = 0.171). In the standard group, 9% of patients were hungry, and 10% were thirsty; no patients experienced adverse effects in either group. Prolonged preoperative fasting may be unnecessary. The 6-4-0 fasting regimen can be applied to pediatric patients before elective surgeries without increasing the incidence of \"at risk stomach,\" but further studies with larger sample size are needed to confirm these results.

      "abstract": "One significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing endotracheal intubation is the aspiration of gastric contents. Its prevalence is more in the emergency than in elective settings. Point-of-care gastric ultrasound (GUS) is a non-invasive bedside ultrasonogram that provides both qualitative and quantitative information about the stomach contents. The diagnostic accuracy of GUS in terms of gastric parameters (measured antral diameters, antral cross-sectional area, and calculated gastric volume) to predict aspiration is yet unknown. We aim to determine this in the patients undergoing urgent emergency intubation (UEI) in the emergency department. A prospective observational study was conducted at the emergency department of a tertiary healthcare center in India. Patients requiring UEI were identified and a bedside gastric ultrasound was done in the right lateral decubitus position using low frequency curved array probe. The qualitative data and the antral diameters (anteroposterior and craniocaudal) were assessed. The patient's clinical parameters and history regarding the last meal were noted. The cross-sectional area of gastric antrum was calculated using CSA = (AP × CC) π/4. The gastric volume is estimated using Perla's formula: GV = 27.0 + 14.6(RLD CSA) -1.28(age). A hundred patients requiring urgent endotracheal intubation were enrolled in the study. Visible aspiration was more in participants with a distended gastric status (χ2 = 16.880, p =  < 0.001). The median gastric volume in the patients who aspirated was 146.37 mL, and it ranged from 111.59 mL-201.01 mL. Using ROC analysis, a cut-off of CC diameter ≥ 2.35 cm (sensitivity 88%, specificity 91%) and AP diameter ≥ 5.15 cm (sensitivity 88%, specificity 87%) predicts aspiration. A calculated USG CSA cut-off ≥ 9.27cm2 (sensitivity 100%, specificity 87%) and an USG gastric volume ≥ 111.594 mL (sensitivity 100%, a specificity 92%) predicts aspiration. Point-of-care gastric ultrasound is an useful non-invasive bedside tool for risk stratification for aspiration in busy emergency rooms. We present threshold gastric antral parameters that can be used to predict aspiration along with its diagnostic accuracy. This can help the treating ED physician take adequate precautions, decide on intubation techniques and treatment modifications to aid in better patient management.",

      "abstract": "In hepatology, the clinical use of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has experienced a notable increase in recent times. These applications range from the diagnosis to the treatment of various liver diseases. Therefore, this systematic review summarizes the evidence for the diagnostic and therapeutic roles of EUS in liver diseases. To examine and summarize the current available evidence of the possible roles of the EUS in making a suitable diagnosis in liver diseases as well as the therapeutic accuracy and efficacy. PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases were extensively searched until October 2023. The methodological quality of the eligible articles was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale or Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. In addition, statistical analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Overall, 45 articles on EUS were included (28 on diagnostic role and 17 on therapeutic role). Pooled analysis demonstrated that EUS diagnostic tests had an accuracy of 92.4% for focal liver lesions (FLL) and 96.6% for parenchymal liver diseases. EUS-guided liver biopsies with either fine needle aspiration or fine needle biopsy had low complication rates when sampling FLL and parenchymal liver diseases (3.1% and 8.7%, respectively). Analysis of data from four studies showed that EUS-guided liver abscess had high clinical (90.7%) and technical success (90.7%) without significant complications. Similarly, EUS-guided interventions for the treatment of gastric varices (GV) have high technical success (98%) and GV obliteration rate (84%) with few complications (15%) and rebleeding events (17%). EUS in liver diseases is a promising technique with the potential to be considered a first-line therapeutic and diagnostic option in selected cases.",

Study quality was assessed using the diagnostic accuracy study quality assessment tool QUADAS-2. Publication bias was tested using funnel plots. Nine articles with a total of 523 study subjects were identified for this review. All studies were feasibility studies. The sensitivity of ultrasound assessment of gastric contents ranged from 53 to 100% and the specificity from 48 to 99%. The combined analysis yielded an area under the working characteristic curve for subjects of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI), 95-98%), a sensitivity of 95% (95% CI, 84-99%), and a specificity of 88% (95% CI, 72-95%). There was a high degree of heterogeneity among the studies due to inter-operator differences and small sample sizes. Ultrasound techniques have high diagnostic accuracy in assessing the nature of gastric contents and their volume in patients. However, most of the studies were feasibility studies with small sample sizes, lacked standardization, and had high risk of bias. More studies are needed in the future to investigate the diagnostic performance of gastric ultrasound assessment techniques. Ultrasonography can be used to assess gastric contents, but standardized data integration and reporting are needed to account for the diagnostic capabilities of this technology. • Ultrasound is a safe and feasible tool for assessing gastric contents. • Ultrasound has good diagnostic performance for gastric contents. • There is still a certain heterogeneity within our analysis process; more research is needed in the future to improve our results.",

      "abstract": "Induction of anesthesia for emergency procedures, without prior gastric preparation and incomplete fasting, is associated with the risk of reflux of stomach contents and aspiration. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of intravenous (IV) metoclopramide administration on gastric emptying in opium users, candidate for procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA). In the present case-control study, opium-dependent (case) and non-dependent (control) patients in need of PSA were administered with 10 mg IV metoclopramide after undergoing gastric ultrasonography for determination of its area and contents. Then, 30 minutes after the administration of metoclopramide, the area and contents of the stomach were measured again and compared with the measures obtained before the intervention. 135 patients were evaluated in three groups of 45, including the case, control, and placebo groups. The three groups were similar regarding mean age (p = 0.068), sex (p = 0.067), weight (p = 0.596), height (p = 0.671), body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.877), duration of fasting (p = 0.596), and type of gastric contents (p = 0.124). Mean antral cross-sectional area (CSA) of the study participants in the case, control, and placebo groups before the administration of the drug was 8.49 ± 1.40, 8.31 ± 2.56, and 6.56 ± 1.72 cm2, respectively. Mean gastric area in the case (p < 0.001) and control (p < 0.001) groups had significantly decreased after the intervention. Mean antral gastric grade of gastric contents in the case (p < 0.001) and control (p < 0.001) groups had significantly decreased after the intervention. It seems that metoclopramide administration in opium users in need of PSA leads to a significant decrease in mean gastric area and increases gastric emptying.",

This study investigates the debate on the necessity of upper endoscopy in UGIB, proposes predictors for adverse outcomes if urgent endoscopy is deferred, and assesses the risk to patient health or results compared to non-urgent endoscopy. A non-randomized controlled study conducted at a single center involved 200 patients with acute life-threatening UGIB. The study group comprised 100 who had an urgent endoscopy within 6 h and a control group included 100 who waited or declined the procedure within 6-24 h. Glasgow-Blatchford score was used for risk stratification of UGIB. Doppler ultrasound was applied to measure lower esophageal wall thickness. D-dimer, lactate, and procalcitonin were measured. The study group revealed recurrent bleeding after 13.5 ± 3.6 days. Death occurred in 4 (4%) which is statistically significant lower (p = 0.024) compared to the control group due to hypovolemic shock, pulmonary embolization, or aspiration pneumonia. Control group showed recurrent bleeding following 15.8 ± 4.7 days (p = 0.306). Death occurred in 14 (14%) of patients due to hypovolemic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or pulmonary embolization. A shorter hospital stay (8.4 ± 3.2 days) was evident in the study group compared to the control group (16.4 ± 2.76 days, p < 0.001). D-dimer, serum lactate, and procalcitonin (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) = 1.004, 2.207, 0.563, p < 0.001, <0.001, 0.011, respectively), and their corresponding values at follow-up (AOR = 0.988, 0.528, 177.04, p < 0.001, 0.011, <0.001, respectively) were significantly associated with higher mortality. Waiting time till endoscopy, baseline D-dimer (AOR = 1.794, 0.998, p < 0.001, 0.014, respectively), creatinine, procalcitonin, and esophageal wall thickness at follow-up were significantly associated with longer hospital stay. The study suggests that higher lower esophageal wall thickness and elevated serum lactate, D-dimer, and procalcitonin are novel triaging markers for early endoscopic intervention, which can improve patient outcomes, reduce blood transfusion risks, and eliminate unnecessary procedures.",

This assessment consists of two evaluations: a qualitative one, in which the status of the antrum, in terms of gastric content, is classified into three categories (empty, liquid content and full), and a quantitative one, where gastric volume is estimated. The objective of this study was to estimate the intra-observer and inter-observer agreement in ultrasound assessment of gastric content and volume in critically ill patients receiving enteral nutrition. A total of 41 patients were included and each examiner performed 64 gastric US (n = 128). Participants' average age was 56.5 years (SD ± 12.6) and 63.4% were men. Regarding the qualitative evaluation of the antrum, in supine position both examiners classified the gastric content as grade 0 in 1 gastric US (1.5%), grade 1 in 4 gastric US (6.2%) and grade 2 in 59 (92.1%). Regarding intra-observer variability in the measurement of the area of the antrum, Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), the difference of means between measurements and the 95% limits of agreement of Bland and Altman values were 0.95 (95% CI 0.940-0.977), - 0.47 cm2 (SD ± 1.64) and - 3.70 cm2 to 2.75 cm2, respectively, in EC1, and 0.94 (95% CI 0.922-0.973), - 0.18 cm2 (SD ± 2.18) and - 4.47 cm2 to 4.09 cm2 in EC2. Concerning to inter-observer variability (EC1 vs EC2) in the measurement of the area of the antrum and of gastric volume, the following CCC, mean difference between measurements and 95% limits of agreement of Bland and Altman values were obtained: measurement of the area of the antrum: 0.84 (95% CI 0.778-0.911), - 0.86 cm2 (SD ± 3.38) and - 7.50 cm2 to 5.78 cm2; gastric volume measurement: 0.84 (95% CI 0.782-0.913), - 12.3 mL (SD ± 49.2) and - 108.8 mL to 84.0 mL. The assessment of gastric content and volume using bedside US in critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation and receiving enteral nutrition showed a good intra and inter-rater reliability. Most of the patients included in the study had a high risk of pulmonary aspiration, since, according to the results of the gastric US evaluation, they had gastric volumes > 1.5 mL/kg.",

      "abstract": "Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is an essential skill in various specialties like anesthesiology, critical care, and emergency medicine. Anesthesiologists utilize POCUS for quick diagnosis and procedural guidance in perioperative and critical care settings. Key applications include vascular ultrasound for challenging venous and arterial catheter placements, gastric ultrasound for aspiration risk assessment, airway ultrasound, diaphragm ultrasound, and lung ultrasound for respiratory assessment. Additional utilities of POCUS can include multi-organ POCUS evaluation for undifferentiated shock or cardiac arrest, ultrasound-guided central neuraxial and peripheral nerve blocks, focused cardiac ultrasound, and novel applications such as venous excess ultrasound. This review highlights these POCUS applications in perioperative and intensive care and summarizes the latest evidence of their accuracy and limitations.",

      "abstract": "Patients with risk factors for gastroparesis are at increased risk for aspiration into the tracheobronchial tree. Current American Society of Anesthesiologists fasting guidelines use subjective measures to determine aspiration risk. A gastric ultrasound protocol can identify patients with risk factors for gastroparesis and determine the need to perform a point-of-care gastric ultrasound to objectively assess gastric antral contents. This enables the anaesthesia provider to assess patients at increased risk for aspiration. Additionally, many patients who present for surgery with risk factors for gastroparesis have an empty gastric antrum. Thus, the gastric ultrasound protocol checklist saves time and manpower requirements of anaesthesia staff without impacting patient safety or perioperative efficiency. A convenience sample of 40 patients consented for surgery was assessed using a screening tool to identify those at risk for gastroparesis and possible aspiration. Patients deemed at risk received a gastric ultrasound examination to evaluate for the presence of gastric contents. Over 12% of these patients had solid food gastric contents on exam. All patients with solid food gastric contents had an American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification of 3 or higher, and two or more risk factors for gastroparesis.",

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists also lead to satiety and appetite reduction through action on the brain's appetite regulation centers, leading to weight loss in obese patients. However, because glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists work to slow gastric emptying, a safety concern has been raised in patients undergoing deep sedation or general anesthesia regarding gastric aspiration, and considering their long half-life in the blood, they are difficult to manage in the perioperative period.

      "abstract": "Cancer (including pancreatic cancer) can develop following a Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection within one year of tuberculosis infection. However, it is unclear whether tuberculosis infection increases the risk of developing adenosquamous carcinoma of the pancreas (ASCP), an extremely rare cancer with a poorer prognosis than pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Herein, we report a case of rapid growing ASCP discovered upon a resection for neck tuberculous lymphadenitis. The patient was a 57-year-old woman. An excisional biopsy of the swollen right neck lymph nodes revealed tuberculous lymphadenitis. One month after the biopsy, an abdominal computed tomography scan showed a 2.0 cm (diameter) ischemic tumor in the pancreatic tail. The tissue obtained using endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration led to the pathological diagnosis of ASCP. Two months after the biopsy, the tumor had grown to 3.5 cm (diameter), and invasion of the stomach and colon was suspected. Distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, partial gastrectomy, and transverse colectomy were performed. The final diagnosis was ASCP (4.7 cm, pT3, pN0, cM0, and pStage IIA). Postoperative adjuvant combination chemotherapy combined with antituberculosis drugs was administered orally. We report the first case of rapidly growing adenosquamous carcinoma resected from the pancreas in association with tuberculous lymphadenitis. Additional evidence is needed to confirm that tuberculosis infection increases the risk of developing pancreatic adenosquamous cell carcinoma because its potential role in promoting squamous metaplasia is unclear.",

      "title": "Efficacy and safety of endoscopic resection in treatment of small gastric stromal tumors: A state-of-the-art review.",
      "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors can occur in any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but gastric stromal tumors (GSTs) are the most common. All GSTs have the potential to become malignant, and these can be divided into four different grades by risk from low to high: Very low risk, low risk, medium risk, and high risk. Current guidelines all recommend early complete excision of GSTs larger than 2 cm in diameter. However, it is not clear whether small GSTs (sGSTs, i.e., those smaller than 2 cm in diameter) should be treated as early as possible. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends that endoscopic ultrasonography-guided (EUS-guided) fine-needle aspiration biopsy and imaging (computed tomography or magnetic-resonance imaging) be used to assess cancer risk for sGSTs detected by gastroscopy to determine treatment. When EUS indicates a higher risk of tumor, surgical resection is recommended. There are some questions on whether sGSTs also require early treatment. Many studies have shown that endoscopic treatment of GSTs with diameters of 2-5 cm is very effective. We here address whether endoscopic therapy is also suitable for sGSTs. In this paper, we try to explain three questions: (1) Does sGST require treatment? (2) Is digestive endoscopy a safe and effective means of treating sGST? and (3) When sGSTs are at different sites and depths, which endoscopic treatment method is more suitable?",

      "abstract": "Introduction Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) are used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. A side effect of GLP1-RAs is delayed gastric emptying, which could increase the risk of pulmonary aspiration. This exploratory pilot study examines the use of ultrasound to identify high-risk patients taking GLP-1RAs before elective surgery. Methods A prospective study from July 2023 to February 2024 was conducted on patients who took their last weekly dose of semaglutide less than seven days before surgery. If preoperative gastric ultrasound revealed an empty stomach, surgery proceeded. Patients with residual gastric contents were rescheduled. Patient demographics, semaglutide dosage and timing, nil per os (NPO) time, and postoperative complications were reviewed. Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. Results Twenty-five patients took their weekly semaglutide less than seven days before surgery. Twenty patients (80%) demonstrated empty stomachs on ultrasound and proceeded with surgery without complications. Gastric contents were found in five patients (20%), and surgery was rescheduled. Patients who took semaglutide one to three days before surgery were more likely to have residual gastric contents as compared to those who took semaglutide four to six days before surgery (p = 0.02). Discussion Gastric ultrasound is a useful tool that can prevent the cancellation of surgery for patients on semaglutide. Patients who took semaglutide within one to three days were more likely to have residual gastric contents compared to those who took it four to six days prior. Conclusion Preoperative gastric ultrasound can identify high-risk patients on semaglutide despite adequate NPO status.",

      "title": "AGA Clinical Practice Update on Endoscopic Management of Perforations in Gastrointestinal Tract: Expert Review.",
      "abstract": "BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: For all procedures, especially procedures carrying an increased risk for perforation, a thorough discussion between the endoscopist and the patient (preferably together with the patient's family) should include details of the procedural techniques and risks involved. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: The area of perforation should be kept clean to prevent any spillage of gastrointestinal contents into the perforation by aspirating liquids and, if necessary, changing the patient position to bring the perforation into a non-dependent location while minimizing insufflation of carbon dioxide to avoid compartment syndrome. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Use of carbon dioxide for insufflation is encouraged for all endoscopic procedures, especially any endoscopic procedure with increased risk of perforation. If available, carbon dioxide should be used for all endoscopic procedures. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: All endoscopists should be aware of the procedures that carry an increased risk for perforation such as any dilation, foreign body removal, any per oral endoscopic myotomy (Zenker's, esophageal, pyloric), stricture incision, thermal coagulation for hemostasis or tumor ablation, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, ampullectomy, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), endoluminal stenting with self-expanding metal stent (SEMS), full-thickness endoscopic resection, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in surgically altered anatomy, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided biliary and pancreatic access, EUS-guided cystogastrostomy, and endoscopic gastroenterostomy using a lumen apposing metal stent (LAMS). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Urgent surgical consultation should be highly considered in all cases with perforation even when endoscopic repair is technically successful. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: For all upper gastrointestinal perforations, the patient should be considered to be admitted for observation, receive intravenous fluids, be kept nothing by mouth, receive broad-spectrum antibiotics (to cover Gram-negative and anaerobic organisms), nasogastric tube (NGT) placement (albeit some exceptions), and surgical consultation. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: For upper gastrointestinal tract perforations, a water-soluble upper gastrointestinal series should be considered to confirm the absence of continuing leak at the perforation site before initiating a clear liquid diet. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Endoscopic closure of esophageal perforations should be pursued when feasible, utilizing through-the-scope clips (TTSCs) or over-the-scope clips (OTSCs) for perforations <2 cm and endoscopic suturing for perforations >2 cm, reserving esophageal stenting with SEMS for cases where primary closure is not possible. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Endoscopic closure of gastric perforations should be pursued when feasible, utilizing TTSCs or OTSCs for perforations <2 cm and endoscopic suturing or combination of TTSCs and endoloop for perforations >2 cm. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: For large type 1 duodenal perforations (lateral duodenal wall tear >3 cm), being cognizant of the difficulty in closing them endoscopically, urgent surgical consultation should be made while the feasibility of endoscopic closure is assessed. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Because type 2 periampullary (retroperitoneal) perforations are subtle and can be easily missed, the endoscopist should carefully assess the gas pattern on fluoroscopy to avoid delays in treatment and request a computed tomography scan if there is a concern for such a perforation; identified perforations of this type at the time of ERCP may be closed with TTSCs if feasible and/or by placing a fully covered SEMS into the bile duct across the ampulla. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 12: For the management of large duodenal polyps, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) should only be performed by experienced endoscopists and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) only by experts because both EMR and ESD in the duodenum require proficiency in resection and mucosal defect closure techniques to manage immediate and/or delayed perforations (caused by the proteolytic enzymes of the pancreas). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 13: Endoscopists should be aware that colon perforations occurring during diagnostic colonoscopy are most commonly located in the sigmoid colon due to direct trauma from forceful advancement of the colonoscope. Such tears recognized at the time of colonoscopy may be closed by TTSCs or OTSCs if the bowel preparation is good and the patient is stable. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 14: Although colon perforation is responsive to various endoscopic tools such as TTSC, OTSC, and endoscopic suturing, perforations in the right colon, especially in the cecum, have been relegated to using only TTSCs because of inability to reach the site of the perforation with an endoscopic suturing device or OTSC if the colon is tortuous or unclean. Recently a new suture-based device for defect closure has been introduced allowing deep submucosal and intramuscular enhanced fixation through a standard gastroscope or colonoscope. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 15: Patients with perforations who are hemodynamically unstable or who have suffered a delayed perforation with peritoneal signs or frank peritonitis should be surgically managed without any attempt at endoscopic closure. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 16: In any adverse event including perforation, it is paramount to ensure accurate documentation, prompt discussion with the patient and family, and swift reporting to the quality officer (or equivalent) and risk management team of the institution (in major adverse events).",

      "abstract": "The use of cricoid compression to prevent insufflation remains controversial, and its use in children is limited. This study aimed to examine the effect of real-time ultrasound-guided esophageal compression on the prevention of gastric insufflation. This prospective observational study was conducted with fifty children aged < 2 years undergoing general anesthesia. Patients were excluded if they were at an increased risk for gastric regurgitation or pulmonary aspiration. Following anesthetic induction under spontaneous breathing, ultrasound-guided esophageal compression was performed during pressure-controlled face-mask ventilation using a gradual increase in peak inspiratory pressure from 10 to 24 cm H2O to determine the pressure at which gastric insufflation occurred. The primary outcome was the incidence of gastric insufflation during anesthetic induction with variable peak inspiratory pressure after real-time ultrasound-guided esophageal compression was applied. Data from a total of 42 patients were analyzed. Gastric insufflation was observed in 2 (4.7%) patients. All patients except one had their esophagus on the left side of the trachea. Applying ultrasound-guided esophageal compression did not affect the percentage of glottic opening scores (P = 0.220). The use of real-time ultrasound-guided esophageal compression pressure can aid preventing gastric insufflation during face-mask ventilation in children less than 2 years old.

      "abstract": "Esophageal retention cysts are rare, benign lesions that can mimic submucosal tumors. Their clinical presentation and imaging characteristics may lead to diagnostic challenges, particularly when fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT (FDG-PET/CT) shows increased uptake, raising suspicion of malignancy. A 77-year-old man presented with epigastric pain. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an esophageal mass, prompting referral to our hospital. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) identified a hypoechoic submucosal tumor with multiple cystic components in the lower esophagus. However, EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) did not yield a definitive diagnosis. CT scan demonstrated a 60-mm space-occupying lesion (SOL) in the lower thoracic esophagus with peripheral contrast enhancement and a central low-density area. MRI revealed a SOL in the lower esophagus with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and moderate signal intensity on T1-weighted images. The lesion contained cystic components exhibiting high T2 and low T1 signal intensities. FDG-PET/CT revealed intense FDG uptake, increasing from maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) 11 to 18 over time. Given the large size of the tumor, symptomatology, and inability to exclude malignancy-particularly high-risk gastrointestinal stromal tumor-surgical resection was performed. Laparoscopic esophagectomy was conducted using intraoperative endoscopy for tumor identification. The esophagus was transected proximally using a linear stapler, followed by extracorporeal gastric conduit reconstruction and the overlap technique was used to perform an esophagogastric anastomosis. Postoperatively, anastomotic leakage was detected on day 3, requiring emergency reoperation. The leak had resolved by POD 26, and the patient was discharged on day 48 after the second surgery (day 51 after the initial surgery). Histopathological examination revealed multiple cysts of varying sizes within the lamina propria, lined by columnar epithelium, with no evidence of malignancy. The final diagnosis was esophageal retention cyst. This case highlights the diagnostic challenge of esophageal retention cysts with high FDG uptake. While PET/CT is essential in oncologic imaging, FDG accumulation does not always indicate malignancy.",

      "abstract": "Although complications of a nasogastric tube (NGT) are identified and managed in daily clinical practice, gastric perforation following NGT insertion is a serious and rarely reported condition in adults. We present a case of a 71-year-old male who was brought to the hospital after having a cardiac arrest. Following stabilisation and receiving an emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), where he required NGT for feeding purposes. A few days later, abdominal distension was noted, and chest imaging was requested mainly for worsening respiratory parameters. A computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed gastric perforation and a misplaced NGT. Being a high-risk patient and in the absence of peritonism and frank sepsis, conservative management was adopted and included proton pump inhibitors (PPI), total parenteral nutrition (TPN), stomach aspiration via a Ryle tube and consideration of imaging-guided drainage. No risk factor for gastric perforation was identified in this presented case. The stable course of follow-up suggested sealed perforation; however, he died due to an extensive intracardiac thrombus. Though this incidence did not contribute directly to the patient's death, it definitely added to the overall morbidity and negatively influenced the management of the other medical conditions. For complement, we also report a review of the ten similar cases in the literature, highlighting the associated risk factors, relevant clinical challenges, lines of management executed. The main aim of this case report is to enhance doctors' awareness of this serious complication, especially in patients with risk factors, and its diagnostic dilemmas. Early recognition and prompt intervention are recommended for a better outcome.",

      "abstract": "Diagnosing early-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, particularly high-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HG-PanIN), remains challenging. Serial pancreatic juice aspiration cytologic examination (SPACE) using an endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage tube has demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy, but its application in surgically altered anatomy is technically demanding. We present a case in which balloon enteroscopy-assisted SPACE led to the diagnosis of HG-PanIN and successful resection. A 70-year-old man with a history of distal gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y reconstruction for gastric cancer underwent follow-up imaging, which revealed localized main pancreatic duct (MPD) stricture and parenchymal atrophy in the pancreatic tail. EUS identified a faint hypoechoic area around the stricture, but no distinct mass. EUS-guided tissue acquisition was inconclusive. Double-balloon enteroscopy-assisted endoscopic retrograde pancreatography was performed, revealing MPD stricture and distal dilation. A 5F endoscopic nasopancreatic drainage tube was placed across the stricture, and SPACE was conducted. Twelve pancreatic juice cytology samples were aspirated every 2 to 3 hours over 3 days, each exceeding 1 mL. One sample (10th) was classified as Class IV, \"suspicious for adenocarcinoma,\" with cytology revealing nuclear enlargement and atypia. The patient was diagnosed preoperatively with pancreatic cancer (TisN0M0 stage 0) and underwent distal pancreatectomy without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Pathology confirmed HG-PanIN of the MPD. The patient had no postoperative adverse events and remained recurrence-free at the 9-month follow-up. This case highlights the effectiveness of balloon enteroscopy-assisted SPACE in diagnosing HG-PanIN in surgically altered anatomy. However, given the relatively high risk of pancreatitis, SPACE should be reserved for patients with imaging or clinical findings suggestive of malignancy. By overcoming technical obstacles, this method offers a promising diagnostic strategy for early-stage pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in surgically altered anatomy.",

      "abstract": "Esophageal gastrointestinal stromal tumors (E-GISTs) are often diagnosed early due to complaints such as dysphagia and are rarely found to be huge in size. Here, we report the treatment of a case of huge E-GIST successfully resected by minimally invasive surgery after neoadjuvant imatinib therapy. An 86-year-old male patient with a 3-month history of dysphagia was referred to our hospital because of a suspected mediastinal tumor on chest X-ray. The chest computed tomography scan revealed a huge solid tumor, of about 100 mm in diameter, protruding into the left thoracic cavity. Histopathological examination results of fine-needle aspiration biopsy under endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a c-kit and CD34-positive esophageal gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The patient received neoadjuvant therapy with imatinib (400 mg/day) to reduce the size of the tumor and prevent rupture during resection. After 28 days of oral administration of imatinib, the tumor size decreased. However, the patient refused to continue treatment with imatinib and therefore underwent mediastino-laparoscopic transhiatal esophagectomy. We successfully resected the tumor completely with mediastino-laparoscopic surgical techniques. Esophageal reconstruction was performed using a gastric tube in the posterior sternal route. After an uneventful postoperative course, the patient was discharged postoperative day 14. Immunohistochemical findings of the resected specimen showed that the tumor cells were positive for c-kit, DOG-1 and CD34 and negative for smooth muscle actin and S100. Hybrid surgical procedure utilizing mediastino-laparoscopy might be useful for high-risk patient with esophageal tumors.",

      "title": "Risk of pulmonary aspiration during semaglutide use and anesthesia in a fasting patient: a case report with tomographic evidence.",
      "abstract": "Pulmonary aspiration of gastric residues during anesthesia is a potentially fatal complication for which no specific treatment is available. The primary way to prevent its occurrence in the context of elective surgeries is adherence to fasting protocols. However, some clinical conditions can prolong the gastric emptying time, and the risk of aspiration may exist despite adequate fasting. Recognizing the risk factors for gastroparesis allows the adoption of preventive methods and is the primary way to reduce morbidity and mortality from pulmonary aspiration. In this scenario, the anesthesiologist can investigate the gastric content by using ultrasound, adjust the anesthetic technique, and even postpone elective surgeries. Here, we describe incidental computed tomography finding of solid contents in the stomach of a patient without prior identification of the risk factors for gastroparesis. The patient underwent elective renal nodule ablation under general anesthesia after fasting for 9 hours. During the procedure, solid contents in the stomach were noted on computed tomography. Subsequently, it was discovered that the patient had been using semaglutide for 6 days and had not disclosed this information. Semaglutide use may represent a new and significant risk factor for anesthesia-related pulmonary aspiration. Until studies provide information on the appropriate perioperative management of patients using semaglutide, anesthesiologists need to adopt preventive measures to avoid aspiration. Awareness of this potential association and open communication among patients, physicians, and anesthesia teams are essential for enhancing patient safety.",

      "abstract": "Fasting guidelines for children recommend restricting clear fluids for one or two hours before a procedure to reduce pulmonary aspiration. Gastric volumes < 1.5 mL·kg-1 do not seem to present an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration. Our aim was to quantify the time to achieve a gastric volume < 1.5 mL·kg-1 after clear fluid ingestion in children. We conducted a prospective observational study in healthy volunteers aged 1-14 yr. Participants followed American Society of Anesthesiologists fasting guidelines prior to data collection. Gastric ultrasound (US) was performed in the right lateral decubitus (RLD) position to determine the antral cross-sectional area (CSA). Following baseline measurements, participants consumed 250 mL of a clear fluid. We then performed gastric US at four time intervals: 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. Data were collected following a predictive model for gastric volume estimation using the formula: volume (mL) = -7.8 + (3.5 × RLD CSA) + (0.127) × age (months). We recruited 33 healthy children aged 2-14 yr. The mean gastric volume per weight (mL·kg-1) at baseline was 0.51 mL·kg-1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46 to 0.57). The mean gastric volume was 1.55 mL·kg-1 (95% CI, 1.36 to 1.75) at 30 min, 1.17 mL·kg-1 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.33) at 60 min, 0.76 mL·kg-1 (95% CI, 0.67 to 0.85) at 90 min, and 0.58 mL·kg-1 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.65) at 120 min. Our results show that total gastric fluid volume was < 1.5 mL·kg-1 after 60 min, suggesting that current fasting guidelines for children could be liberalized.",

      "abstract": "Perioperative management of patients receiving a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) remains challenging for the anesthesiologist. Despite the approval of GLP-1 RAs 2 decades ago, the recent reports of aspiration and postoperative pulmonary complications drew attention to this group of medications and resulted in multiple societal guidelines that would provide recommendations for anesthesiologists and proceduralists on the appropriate perioperative management of GLP-1 RAs. However, despite these guidelines and proposed options, there was a lack of adequate evidence to support holding versus continuing the medication, as well as data related to the role of gastric ultrasound in that decision-making process. The release of multiple societal guidelines and studies evaluating the impact of GLP-1 RAs on perioperative outcomes resulted in more controversy and uncertainty for the clinician anesthesiologist to follow. The ultimate goal for perioperative management of these medications is to evaluate an individual patient's risk of aspiration, rather than assuming the risk is low when holding the medication appropriately or high if not holding it. Furthermore, it is unclear whether holding these types of medicines or unnecessary postponing of surgery may result in adverse outcomes. In this narrative review, we present a summary of the existing literature on the topic with a focus on the risk of aspiration and a recommendation for perioperative management to include the utilization of gastric ultrasound for surgery patients based on their risks.",

      "abstract": "A period of fasting before tracheal extubation of ventilated patients in the ICU is common practice, aiming to reduce gastric volume and aspiration risk. As the volume of gastric content is unknown at the time of extubation, the efficacy of this practice is uncertain. A prospective, observational study using gastric ultrasound was undertaken. Images were obtained at four time points: (i) at baseline, with gastric feeds running; (ii) after suctioning of gastric contents through a gastric tube; (iii) after a 4 h period with no gastric feed running; and (iv) after both a 4 h fasting period and gastric tube suctioning. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients classed as low risk of aspiration with each intervention, using qualitative and quantitative gastric ultrasound. Fifty-four patients in the ICU were enrolled. Forty-four (81%) subjects had images that were suitable for analysis. Suctioning of stomach content through a gastric tube and fasting were equivalent with 39/44 (88.6%) and 5/44 (11.4%) subjects classified as low risk and at risk of aspiration, respectively. A period of fasting followed by suction resulted in 41/44 (93.2%) patients being at low risk. Suctioning of stomach contents through the gastric tube and a 4 h fasting period appear equivalent at reducing gastric volume below a safe threshold. A small percentage did not reach the threshold despite all interventions.",

      "abstract": "The presence of gastric content increases the risk of aspiration during general anesthesia. Diabetic patients have delayed gastric emptying; however, despite adequate fasting because of diabetic gastroparesis these patients have a high risk of aspiration. This study aimed to compare ultrasound-guided measurement of residual gastric volume between diabetic and non-diabetic patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia. This prospective observational study included 80 patients divided into two groups of 40 diabetic patients with a minimum of 8 years history of diabetes and 40 nondiabetic patients aged >18 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists' physical status I-II kept with similar fasting intervals. Before induction of general anesthesia, gastric ultrasound was performed using standard gastric scanning protocol to measure craniocaudal (CC) and anteroposterior (AP) diameters followed by calculation of antral cross-sectional area (CSA) and gastric volume in semi-sitting (SS) and right lateral decubitus (RLD) position using curved array probe. The gastric antrum volume (GV) was classified as Grade 0, 1, or 2, and risk stratification for aspiration was done. The nasogastric tube was inserted after induction of anesthesia to aspirate and compare the gastric content. In the semi-sitting position, the mean CC and AP diameters were 16.38 ± 3.31 mm and 10.1 ± 2.53 mm in the non-diabetic group and 25.19 ± 4.08 mm and 15.8 ± 3.51 mm in the diabetic group, respectively. In RLD, CC was 1.91 ± 0.38 cm and AP was 1.19 ± 0.34 cm in the non-diabetic group as compared to the CC of 2.78 ± 0.4 cm and AP of 1.81 ± 0.39 cm in the diabetic group. The calculated CSA of 318.23 ± 97.14 mm2 and 4 ± 1.1 cm2 in diabetic were significantly higher than 133.12 ± 58.56 mm2 and 1.83 ± 0.83 cm2 of non-diabetic, in SS (p < 0.0001) and RLD (p < 0.0001) positions, respectively. The GV of 15.48 ± 11.18 ml in the diabetic group was significantly higher than (-) 9.77 ± 18.56 ml in the non-diabetic group (p < 0.0001). Despite the differences in CSA and GV between diabetic and non-diabetic groups, both groups showed a low gastric residual volume (<1.5 ml/kg). The gastric tube aspirate in the non-diabetic and diabetic groups was 0.3 ± 0.78 ml and 1.24 ± 1.46 ml, respectively, and was statistically significant (p = 0.0006). Patients with long-standing diabetes showed higher gastric residual and antral CSA when compared with non-diabetic patients. The clinical significance of these findings needs further evidence for the formulation of specific guidelines for diabetic patients.",

      "abstract": "Failure to adhere to perioperative fasting requirements increases aspiration risk and can lead to delay or cancellation of surgery. Point of care gastric ultrasound may guide decision-making to delay, cancel or proceed with surgery. This study aimed to describe gastric contents using point of care gastric ultrasound in pediatric patients with known fasting guideline violations presenting for elective surgery. This was a single-center retrospectivechart review of gastric ultrasound scans in patients presenting for elective surgeries with \"nothing by mouth\" violation (per fasting guidelines) or unclear fasting status. The primary outcome is description of gastric contents using point of care ultrasound. The ultrasound findings were classified as low-risk for aspiration (empty, clear fluid < 1.5 ml/kg), high-risk (solids, clear fluid > 1.5 ml/kg), or inconclusive study. Gastric ultrasound findings were communicated to the attending anesthesiologist. For patients proceeding without delay the estimated time saved was defined as the difference between ultrasound scan time and presumed case start time based on American Society of Anesthesiologists fasting guidelines. We identified 106 patients with a median age of 4.8 years. There were 31 patients (29.2%) that had ultrasound finding of high-risk gastric contents. These patients had cases that were delayed, cancelled or proceeded with rapid sequence intubation. Sixty-six patients (62.3%) were determined to be low-risk gastric contents and proceeded with surgery without delay. For these patients, a median of 2.6 h was saved. No aspiration events were recorded for any patients. It is feasible to use preoperative point of care gastric ultrasound to determine stomach contents and risk-stratify pediatric patients presenting for elective surgical procedures with fasting non-adherence. Preoperative gastric ultrasound may have a role in determining changes in anesthetic management in this patient population.",

      "abstract": "Pulmonary aspiration is an adverse event with high morbidity and mortality. Despite fasting for > 8 hr, some patients still have residual gastric volume and are thus at risk of aspiration. We aimed to determine the accuracy of gastric ultrasound in assessing residual gastric content in patients undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. In a prospective cohort study, we performed gastric ultrasound immediately before upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in a sample of 294 patients. We categorized the ultrasound results as high risk of aspiration when the fluid volume was > 1.5 mL·kg-1 or when there was thick/solid content. We applied Spearman's test to determine the correlation between aspirated volume and ultrasound-estimated volume using three mathematical models. We assessed the method's accuracy by calculating its sensitivity and specificity. We included 282 patients in the analysis. The incidence of residual gastric contents was 5%. There were no aspiration events. Prokinetic use (relative risk [RR], 7.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.9 to 29.1; P < 0.01), previous stroke (RR, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.2 to 13.6; P = 0.02), and male sex (RR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.2 to 9.4; P = 0.02) were significantly more frequent among those with residual gastric content. The ultrasonography's specificity and sensitivity to predict gastric content at risk of aspiration were 100% and 77%, respectively, with a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 99%. Ultrasonography was an effective way to assess residual gastric content, which can help improve patient safety.",

      "abstract": "Gastrointestinal tract contrast medium studies are a valuable diagnostic modality to evaluate gastrointestinal anatomy, motility, and pathology. Four positive contrast medium studies were performed twice on a harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) and once each on two California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) to evaluate for gastrointestinal abnormalities by using barium-impregnated gelatin. Because marine mammals in human care routinely receive plain gelatin as a component of their diet and as secondary reinforcement, feeding a barium gelatin mitigates the need for tube feeding or restraint. Operant conditioning was used to position the pinnipeds for voluntary radiographs. The barium gelatin permitted adequate evaluation of gastric emptying and intestinal transit times and good evaluation of the structure of the intestinal tract. Full evaluation of gastric anatomy was limited due to the gelatin blocks not conforming to the stomach in their solid form and the barium quickly exiting the stomach as barium gelatin blocks disintegrated and because orthogonal views could not always be acquired. Even with these limitations, barium gelatin resulted in diagnostically valuable contrast imaging in a stress-free patient setting with reduced risk of aspiration and eliminated the effects that anesthesia can have on gastric motility as well as other anesthesia-associated risks.",

      "abstract": "Accurate assessment of the nature of enlarged retropharyngeal lymph nodes (RLN) of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) patients after radiotherapy is related to selecting appropriate treatments and avoiding unnecessary therapy. This study aimed to develop a non-invasive and effective model for predicting the recurrence of RLN (RRLN) in NPC. The data of post-radiotherapy NPC patients (N = 76) with abnormal enlargement of RLN who underwent endonasopharyngeal ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspirations (EPUS-FNA) were examined. They were randomly divided into a discovery (n = 53) and validation (n = 23) cohort. Univariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between variables (magnetic resonance imaging characteristics, EBV DNA) and RRLN. Multiple logistic regression was used to construct a prediction model. The accuracy of the model was assessed by discrimination and calibration, and decision curves were used to assess the clinical reliability of the model for the identification of high risk RLNs for possible recurrence. Abnormal enhancement, minimum axis diameter (MAD) and EBV-DNA were identified as independent risk factors for RRLN and could stratify NPC patients into three risk groups. The probability of RRLN in the low-, medium-, and high-risk groups were 37.5, 82.4, and 100%, respectively. The AUC of the final predictive model was 0.882 (95% CI: 0.782-0.982) in the discovery cohort and 0.926 (95% CI, 0.827-1.000) in the validation cohort, demonstrating good clinical accuracy for predicting the RRLN of NPC patients. The favorable performance of the model was confirmed by the calibration plot and decision curve analysis. The nomogram model constructed in the study could be reliable in predicting the risk of RRLN after radiotherapy for NPC patients.",

      "abstract": "Owing to concerns about delayed gastric emptying or hyperglycemia, evidence is lacking regarding whether pre-operative carbohydrate loading can be routinely administered to patients with type 2 diabetes. The objective of this study was to determine the aspiration risk and gastric volume after pre-operative carbohydrate loading in patients with type 2 diabetes. A prospective, single-center, observational cohort study. The study was conducted at a tertiary teaching hospital in Seoul, Korea, from May 2020 to May 2021. Patients (n = 49) with type 2 diabetes underwent elective noncardiac surgery. All patients were administered carbohydrate loading two hours before surgery. Once in the operating room, they underwent gastric ultrasonography to determine gastric volume. The anesthesiologists monitored the patients' glucose concentrations during and after surgery. The primary outcome was the predicted risk of aspiration. The secondary outcomes were gastric volume, antral grade, satisfaction score, and perioperative glucose profile. Forty-nine patients were analyzed. All patients had a low risk of aspiration after carbohydrate loading, as follows: 33 (67.3%) patients classified as antral grade 0 and 16 (32.7%) patients classified as antral grade 1. The median time from carbohydrate drink ingestion to ultrasound examination was 120 min (IQR 115-139). After carbohydrate loading, the median gastric volume in the right-lateral position after carbohydrate loading was 2.64 ml (IQR 0.00-32.05). The mean glucose concentrations (SD) were 134 (24) mg/dl, 159 (37) mg/dl, 150 (32) mg/dl, and 165 (36) mg/dl at baseline, after induction, 30 min after surgery, and in the post anesthesia care unit, respectively. The median satisfaction score of the patients was 5 (IQR 4-5).

      "title": "A Scoping Review of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists: Are They Associated with Increased Gastric Contents, Regurgitation, and Aspiration Events?",
      "abstract": "Background: The increased popularity and ubiquitous use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) for the treatment of diabetes, heart failure, and obesity has led to significant concern for increased risk for perioperative aspiration, given their effects on delayed gastric emptying. This concern is highlighted by many major societies that have published varying guidance on the perioperative management of these medications, given limited data. We conducted a scoping review of the available literature regarding the aspiration risk and aspiration/regurgitant events related to GLP-1 RAs. Methods: A librarian-assisted search was performed using five electronic medical databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science Platform Databases, including Web of Science Core Collection, KCI Korean Journal Database, MEDLINE, and Preprint Citation Index) from inception through March 2024 for articles that reported endoscopic, ultrasound, and nasogastric evaluation for increased residual gastric volume retained food contents, as well as incidences of regurgitation and aspiration events. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full text of articles to determine eligibility. Data extraction was performed using customized fields established a priori within a systematic review software system. Results: Of the 3712 citations identified, 24 studies met eligibility criteria. Studies included four prospective, six retrospective, five case series, and nine case reports. The GLP-1 RAs reported in the studies included semaglutide, liraglutide, lixisenatide, dulaglutide, tirzepatide, and exenatide. All studies, except one case report, reported patients with confounding factors for retained gastric contents and aspiration, such as a history of diabetes, cirrhosis, hypothyroidism, psychiatric disorders, gastric reflux, Barrett's esophagus, Parkinson's disease, dysphagia, obstructive sleep apnea, gastric polyps, prior abdominal surgeries, autoimmune diseases, pain, ASA physical status classification, procedural factors (i.e., thyroid surgery associated with risk for nausea, ketamine associated with nausea and secretions), and/or medications associated with delayed gastric emptying (opioids, anticholinergics, antidepressants, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, DPP-IV inhibitors, and antacids). Of the eight studies (three prospective and five retrospective) that evaluated residual contents in both GLP-1 users and non-users, seven studies (n = 7/8) reported a significant increase in residual gastric contents in GLP-1 users compared to non-users (19-56% vs. 5-20%). In the three retrospective studies that evaluated for aspiration events, there was no significant difference in aspiration events, with one study reporting aspiration rates of 4.8 cases per 10,000 in GLP-1 RA users compared to 4.6 cases per 10,000 in nonusers and the remaining two studies reporting one aspiration event in the GLP-1 RA user group and none in the non-user group. In one study that evaluated for regurgitation or reflux by esophageal manometry and pH, there was no significant difference in reflux episodes but a reduction in gastric acidity in the GLP-1 RA user group compared to the non-user group. Conclusions: There is significant variability in the findings reported in the studies, and most of these studies include confounding factors that may influence the association between GLP-1 RAs and an increased risk of aspiration and related events. While GLP-1 RAs do increase residual gastric contents in line with their mechanism of action, the currently available data do not suggest a significant increase in aspiration and regurgitation events associated with their use and the withholding of GLP-1 RAs to reduce aspiration and regurgitation events, as is currently recommended by many major societal guidelines. Large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) may be helpful in further elucidating the impact of GLP-1 RAs on perioperative aspiration risk.",

      "abstract": "A woman in her 80s was diagnosed with pancreatic tail cancer by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). We performed laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 for 6 months. One year after surgery, contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed a 15 mm mass in the posterior wall of the gastric body. EUS showed a hypoechoic mass in the muscular layer in the gastric wall, which was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma by FNA. We diagnosed gastric wall recurrence due to needle tract seeding(NTS)following EUS-FNA and performed partial gastrectomy. Histopathological diagnosis was gastric wall recurrence of pancreatic cancer. Since NTS following EUS-FNA can be proven only by the presence of gastric wall recurrence after surgery for pancreatic body or tail cancer, the actual risk of NTS including peritoneal dissemination is not clear and may have been underestimated. In case of resectable pancreatic body or tail cancer, indication for EUS-FNA should be carefully considered.",

      "abstract": "Gastric point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) may offer clinical value in assessing aspiration risk among medically complex patients undergoing regional anesthesia and pain procedures. While the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) preoperative fasting guidelines primarily apply to healthy individuals, medically complex populations often present with differing gastric emptying and aspiration risk. This narrative review, conducted by the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (ASRA-PM), adhered to PRISMA guidelines and was registered with PROSPERO. It focused on seven medically complex patient groups: those who are pregnant, obese, diabetic, have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), are receiving emergency care, are enterally fed, or are taking GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA). Study quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). Practice recommendations were developed using an iterative expert consensus process, with final recommendations based on evidence strength, clinical relevance, and expert agreement. Findings support the use of gastric POCUS in patients in active labor, those undergoing urgent cesarean sections, and those with diabetes. Conditional support is given for obesity, emergency care, enteral feeding, and GLP-1RA use. Routine use is not recommended in non-laboring pregnancies, elective cesarean delivery, or GERD. While gastric POCUS may aid with aspiration risk evaluation, its use should complement clinical judgment. Implementation may be limited by practical and training constraints, requiring individualized decision-making.

      "title": "Effects of Preoperative Oral Carbohydrate on Cirrhotic Patients under Endoscopic Therapy with Anesthesia: A Randomized Controlled Trial.",
      "abstract": "Preoperative fasting causes significant perioperative discomfort in patients. Preoperative oral carbohydrate (POC) is an important element of the enhanced recovery after surgery protocol, but its effect on cirrhotic patients who tend to have abnormal gastric emptying remains unclarified. We investigated the influence of POC on gastric emptying and preprocedural well-being in cirrhotic patients. A prospective, randomized, controlled study of cirrhotic patients with gastroesophageal varices scheduled for elective therapeutic endoscopy under intravenous anesthesia was conducted. We enrolled 180 patients and divided them into three groups: those not supplemented with carbohydrates for 8 h before therapeutic endoscopy (control group) and those administered a carbohydrate beverage 2 h (2 h group) and 4 h (4 h group) before endoscopy. The residual gastric volume was quantified before anesthesia, gastric emptying was evaluated using gastric ultrasonography, and preprocedural well-being was assessed using the visual analogue scale (VAS). Preanesthesia gastric sonography scores were similar among the three groups. No patient had residual gastric volume > 1.5 ml/kg in the control and 4 h groups, but six patients (11%) had a residual gastric volume of >1.5 ml/kg in the 2 h group, hence were at a risk of regurgitation and aspiration. Moreover, VAS scores for six parameters (thirst, hunger, mouth dryness, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue) in the 2 h group and three parameters (thirst, hunger, and mouth dryness) in the 4 h group were significantly lower than those in the control group, suggesting a beneficial effect on cirrhotic patients' well-being. Preoperative gastric peristaltic and operation scores, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and in-hospital expenses were not significantly different among the three groups. Our study indicated that avoiding preoperative fasting with oral carbohydrates administered 4 h before anesthesia can be achieved in cirrhotic patients. Further studies to assess whether POC can help improve postoperative outcomes in cirrhotic patients are needed.",

      "abstract": "Patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) have an increased risk of pancreatic and extrapancreatic malignancies. Lymphomas are rare extrapancreatic malignancies, and in situ collisions of early gastric cancer and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are even rarer. Here, we report the first case of pancreatic cancer comorbid with in situ collision of extrapancreatic malignancies (early gastric cancer and DLBCL) in a follow-up IPMN patient. Furthermore, we have made innovations in the treatment of such cases. An 81-year-old Japanese female diagnosed with IPMN developed elevated carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 levels during follow-up. Because her CA19-9 levels continued to rise, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) was performed and revealed a suspicious lesion at the pancreatic tail. However, lesions in the pancreas were not found by computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. To make an exact patho-logical diagnosis, EUS-guided fine needle aspiration was performed. To our supprise, early gastric cancer was found in preoperative gastroscopy. The gastric cancer was completely resected through endoscopic submucosal dissection before postoperative pathology identified early adenocarcinoma collided with DLBCL. Subsequent EUS-guided fine needle aspiration provided pathological support for the pancreatic cancer diagnosis, and then laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. CA19-9 levels returned to normal postoperatively. Endoscopic submucosal dissection is appropriate for submucosal lymphomas in patients intoleratant of chemotherapy. EUS can detect small IPMN-related pancreatic tumors.",

      "title": "Preoperative Ultrasonographic Assessment of the Gastric Antrum in Diabetic Patients Before Elective Surgery: A Prospective Observational Comparative Cohort Study.",
      "abstract": "Diabetic patients may have neuropathy-induced gastroparesis predisposing them to aspiration. Point-of-care gastric ultrasonography (GUSG) is useful in the qualitative assessment of the antrum and quantitative prediction of gastric volume (GV) in diabetic patients. In this study, we compared the GUSG findings between fasting diabetic and non-diabetic patients in the elective preoperative setting. A total of 220 patients were included in the study with 110 diabetic patients in the diabetes mellitus (DM) group and 110 non-diabetic patients in the non-diabetes mellitus (NDM) group. GUSG was performed in supine and right lateral decubitus (RLD) positions and qualitative grading was done. An empty antrum in both supine and RLD positions was graded 0. Fluid present in the RLD position but empty in the supine position was graded 1. The presence of solids or fluid in both supine and RLD positions was graded 2. Quantitative assessment was done by calculating the estimated GV using the measured cross-sectional area (CSA). The presence of grade 2 antrum or solids or GV >0.8 mL/kg was considered as criteria for a 'high-risk' antrum. Grade 2 antrum was found in 18% of patients in the diabetic group compared to 3% in the non-diabetic group. Mean CSA (5.65 cm2) and mean GV (34.52 mL) were significantly higher in diabetic patients. Forty-one (37.2%) patients among the diabetic patients had a high-risk antrum and a potentially higher risk of aspiration when compared to non-diabetic patients. Higher age and female gender were found to be associated with the incidence of 'high-risk' antrum in the univariate logistic regression model. Diabetic patients have a higher incidence of grade 2 antrum, and higher CSA and GV, when compared to non-diabetic patients. Risk factors such as female gender and increasing age are associated with the high-risk antrum incidence. Further studies where objective tests are done to identify the presence of diabetic autonomic neuropathy might help determine the relationship between GUSG and aspiration risk.",

      "title": "Benign pyloric adenomyoma presented as gastric outlet obstruction: a case report and review of the literature.",
      "abstract": "Gastric adenomyoma is a rare benign tumor composed of glandular structures and smooth muscle fibers. While some classify gastric adenomyoma as a hamartoma, others view it as an abortive form of heterotopic pancreas. Despite its benign nature, there is a risk of malignant transformation. Predominantly found in the antrum, gastric adenomyoma affects all ages but is most common in adults aged 40-60 years. Symptoms are nonspecific, and its similarity to other lesions complicates diagnosis. This paper aims to provide a review of medical literature on gastric adenomyoma and its diagnosis and treatment methods, along with presenting an additional case report on the same topic. We present the case of a 55-year-old Syrian man who experienced vomiting, weight loss, and chronic partial constipation. An obstructing mass in the pylorus was detected, and then an open surgery was performed to excise the lesion. A biopsy of the resected mass was obtained for histopathological examination. The final diagnosis of the lesion was pyloric-region adenomyoma with severe pyloric stenosis. After the successful surgery, the patient recovered without any recurrence or complications. Several diagnostic approaches are available, including radiological studies, endoscopic examination, and fine needle aspiration guided by endoscopic ultrasonography. Treatment options involve endoscopic submucosal dissection and complete laparotomy resection. Further studies and thorough reviews are recommended to better understand the best clinical practices. Practitioners should consider gastric adenomyoma when encountering a mural gastric lesion.",

      "abstract": "Although preoperative carbohydrate loading (PCL) is generally regarded as safe, the significance of assessing gastric status by gastric ultrasound after PCL application has not been adequately explored in real-world clinical settings. Therefore, this study evaluated gastric status after PCL using gastric ultrasound and its potential role in enhancing patient safety within a large surgical cohort under Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols. We retrospectively analyzed patients who received PCL and underwent hepatobiliary surgery within ERAS protocol between November 2018 to December 2023. The primary outcome was the incidence of an increased gastric content. Secondary outcomes included PCL compliance, gastric ultrasound data, fasting intervals, the incidence of rapid sequence intubation (RSI) and aspiration, and predictive factors for increased gastric content. Of the 1187 patients, the compliance rate for PCL applications within the ERAS protocol reached 88%, with 746 patients included in the final analysis. Fasting hours duration < 2 h in 7.2% of cases. The incidence of an increased gastric content was 4.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.5-6.6%), observed in 36 patients. RSI was performed in all patients with an increased gastric content, with no aspiration reported. Multivariate logistic regression identified BMI as the only independent predictor of increased gastric content (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.57-0.77, P < 0.001). Patients receiving PCL within the ERAS protocol may be safe in clinical practice without an elevated risk of having an increased gastric content. However, individual variability and associated risk factors need consideration. Not applicable.",

A total of 684 respondents were included in the final analysis (59 department heads, 366 consultants, 99 registrars, 160 nurse anaesthetists). The response rate from physicians was 47%. Consensus (>80% agreement or disagreement) was reached on 9/12 (75%) questions regarding preparation for rapid sequence induction (RSI), 6/13 (46%) regarding RSI practice and 3/8 (38%) regarding management of aspiration incidents. Major controversies included high-flow pre-oxygenation (55% agreement), the validity of modified RSI in adults (52% agreement), the primary use of video-laryngoscope (76% agreement) and management of apparent regurgitation. Subjective factors such as clinical presentation were considered more important than objective factors such as medical history, comorbidities or gastric ultrasound. Across a wide range of experience and professional groups, we found a strong consensus on the indication and performance of 'traditional' RSI. However, clinical decision-making still relies heavily on subjective impressions, while newer risk stratification and management techniques remain controversial.",

      "abstract": "There is ongoing debate regarding the optimal general anaesthetic technique for manual removal of the placenta after vaginal delivery. Using ultrasound examination of the gastric antrum, this study aimed to assess the change in gastric contents during vaginal delivery and to determine the prevalence of stomach at risk for pulmonary aspiration in the immediate postpartum period before placental delivery. In this prospective multicentre cohort study, antral ultrasonography was performed at full cervical dilatation within the thirty minutes preceding the beginning of expulsive efforts and after vaginal birth, before placental delivery. High-risk gastric content was defined as the visualisation of any solid content in the antrum or antral cross-sectional area in the semi-recumbent position (SR-CSA) > 608 mm². Twenty-six women were included and analysed. There was a significant decrease in both the proportion of patients with solid gastric content and the SR-CSA between the two-ultrasound examinations. Twenty-one patients (80.8%) exhibited a decrease in the SR-CSA during vaginal delivery. The prevalence of stomach at risk for pulmonary aspiration was significantly lower after vaginal delivery than before vaginal delivery (23.1% vs. 57.7%, P = 0.0004). Our results suggest that gastric emptying is at least partially preserved during vaginal birth. Nevertheless, almost a quarter of women did have high-risk gastric content in the immediate postpartum period. Point-of-care antral ultrasonography may be of interest for the fast assessment of the gastric content status when a general anaesthesia is required for manual removal of retained placenta.",

      "abstract": "Esophageal carcinoma is an aggressive cancer with extremely poor therapeutic outcomes due to its high metastatic potential and a significant risk of recurrence after radical resection. Liver is the most common metastatic target organ of esophageal carcinoma, followed by the lungs, bones, and brain. Few cases of solitary pancreatic and hepatic metastases of esophageal carcinoma have been reported. We report the case of a 67-year-old male presenting with pancreatic and hepatic lesions. In addition, a friable lesion with an irregular nodular surface in the distal esophagus was detected by esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Pathohistological examination confirmed esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The pancreatic lesion was also biopsied via ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration, which also revealed squamous cell carcinoma. The hepatic lesion was also identified as metastatic carcinoma by magnetic resonance imaging, most likely of the same origin. Due to comorbidities that precluded surgery, the patient was administered adjuvant therapy and a multidisciplinary decision was made for palliative care. The patient died 1 month later due to multiorgan failure caused by hemorrhage from a peptic ulcer. To our knowledge, this is only the sixth case of pancreatic metastasis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. This case report suggests to clinicians the importance of considering potential comorbidities in every patient with advanced cancer, such as gastric ulcer and cachexia.",

      "abstract": "The increasing prescription of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists presents a peri-operative challenge for anaesthetists. These drugs delay gastric emptying, potentially increasing pulmonary aspiration risk. Despite recent recommendations from the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists, Australian Society of Anaesthetists, and American Society of Anesthesiologists, there remain no formalised guidelines regarding preoperative optimisation for patients taking GLP-1 agonists. Given the current lack of evidence, we present a case series of incidents involving patients treated with GLP-1 agonists reported to webAIRS, a web-based anaesthetic incident reporting system in Australia and New Zealand. Among 11,700 reports from July 2009 to April 2024, 13 incidents related to GLP-1 agonist use were identified, including seven cases concerning aspiration. Patient factors potentially contributing to increased aspiration risks in these incidents included a higher body mass index, type 2 diabetes mellitus, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, emergency case, and time from GLP-1 agonist cessation. Most incidents involved a rapid sequence induction for general anaesthesia with no cases utilising gastric ultrasound, preoperative nasogastric tube insertion, or intravenous erythromycin use. This case series highlights the potential concerns relating to GLP-1 treatment in the perioperative setting. Interdisciplinary collaboration and communication between anaesthetists, surgeons, general practitioners and endocrinologists are required to further investigate and establish preoperative guidelines for safe GLP-1 agonist use. Specifically, consideration in determining actual gastric contents of each patient despite generic fasting guidelines is needed. Early preoperative risk stratification should also improve patient safety and outcomes.",

We describe a technique for safe retrieval of an Allurion IGB using endoscopic accessories available at hospitals without a dedicated bariatric service. Nausea and pain are often encountered following IGB insertion. Infrequent but serious adverse events have been noted by NICE. As it does not normally require endoscopic removal, a specific endoscopic kit has not been designed for the Allurion IGB. Devices designed for other types of IGBs have previously been used to extract the Allurion balloon. We achieved a similar outcome using an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) aspiration needle. Although general anaesthetic for IGB removal remains contentious, we felt this represented the safest strategy given the risk of aspiration as well as the lack of prior experience at our centre.",

This procedure results in loss of the lower oesophageal sphincter, which increases the risk of pulmonary aspiration in patients presenting for subsequent surgeries. Consequently, innovative strategies are needed to enhance safety during airway management. Although Sellick manoeuvre (cricoid pressure) is commonly used to mitigate the risk of aspiration, there is limited evidence to support its efficacy. Additionally, cricoid pressure may not be effective in patients who have undergone oesophagectomy because of the altered neck anatomy. In this case series, we present seven post-oesophagectomy patients who underwent ultrasound-guided modified Sellick manoeuvre for airway management. During tracheal intubation with a videolaryngoscope, the gastric conduit in the neck was visualised and compressed with the ultrasound probe, attempting to oppose both walls of the conduit and reduce the risk of regurgitation. This approach addresses the challenges posed by altered anatomy and the limitations of traditional cricoid pressure, potentially enhancing the safety of airway management in these patients. While ultrasound-guided oesophageal compression shows promise as a feasible technique, further studies are needed to validate its effectiveness.",

The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) recommends preoperative fasting of 8 hours after a full meal. ASA preoperative fasting recommendation is based on the Western diet. A typical Western diet has a higher fat content than Asian standard solid meals. This study aimed to analyze intragastric volume with ultrasound after 6-hour and 8-hour fasting after an Asian traditional solid meal. This cohort study recruited 37 subjects from January to February 2019. Subjects were patients scheduled for elective non-digestive surgery and planned for preoperative fasting of 8 hours. Before preoperative fasting, all subjects consumed standard Asian meals. We performed an ultrasound of the gastric antrum during the relaxation phase after two contractions. After a good image was acquired, the cross-sectional area and gastric volume (GV) were calculated. GV was grouped based on a border value of 1.5 mL/kg. GV 6 hours after solid intake was 30.93 (1.60-205.25) mL, and GV 8 hours after solid intake was 16.34 (0.73-62.49) mL (P = 0.002). After 6 hours, 5.4% of the subjects had a GV above 1.5 mL/ kg, while after fasting for 8 hours, the GV of all subjects was below 1.5 mL/kg.

In this prospective observational study, we aimed to assess the volume of gastric contents in patients undergoing this neurosurgical procedure using ultrasound, and to determine the factors associated with volume change. Eighty-two patients diagnosed with pituitary adenoma were recruited consecutively. Semi-quantitative (Perlas scores: 0, 1 and 2) and quantitative (cross-sectional area, CSA) ultrasound assessments of the gastric antrum were performed immediately before and after surgery in the semi-recumbent and semi-recumbent right-lateral positions. Seven (8.5%) patients had antrum scores from preoperative grade 0 to postoperative grade 2; nine (11%) patients had antrum scores from preoperative grade 0 to postoperative grade 1. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) of increased gastric volume was 71.0 ± 33.1 mL and 236.5 ± 32.4 mL in postoperative grade 1 and 2 groups, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that 11 (13.4%) patients (4 in grade 1 and all in grade 2) had postoperative estimated gastric volume > 1.5 mL kg-1 (mean ± SD 3.08 ± 1.67, range 1.51-5.01 mL kg-1). Logistic regression analysis revealed that older age, diabetes mellitus, and long surgical duration were independent risk factors for significant volume change (all P < 0.05). Our results showed a significant increase in gastric volume in some patients who underwent EETS. Bedside ultrasound measurements of gastric volume can be used to assess the postoperative aspiration risk, particularly in older diabetic patients with a longer surgical duration.",

This prospective observational study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital between January 2021 and February 2022. A total of 122 patients included in the study were divided into two groups: group D (n = 61) patients had a history of diabetes mellitus and group C (n = 61) patients were non-diabetics (control). Gastric ultrasound was performed in supine and right lateral decubitus (RLD) positions. The following parameters were measured: duration of fasting, craniocaudal (CC) diameter, anteroposterior (AP) diameter, cross-sectional area (CSA), and GV using CC and AP diameters. The mean age of the participants was found to be 46.60 ± 13.77 years with 51.6% female patients and 48.4% male patients.

Similarly, there was a significantly higher mean level of CC diameter, AP diameter, and CSA in the RLD position in diabetics compared to healthy individuals (p < 0.05). The GV was significantly higher in diabetics (9.96 ± 14.520) compared to healthy individuals (-8.991 ± 20.95; p < 0.05). Fasting GV assessed using POC ultrasonography in diabetic individuals was higher when compared to non-diabetics after similar periods of fasting.",

      "title": "Ultrasound Assessment of Gastric Volume in Parturients After High-Flow Nasal Oxygen Therapy.",
      "abstract": "High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) therapy is widely used in critical care obstetrics to improve oxygenation. Much of the benefit of HFNO is linked to the creation of modest levels of positive airway pressure. Pregnant women are generally considered to be at high risk of regurgitation and aspiration. It is unknown whether HFNO may cause gas insufflation into the stomach and further increase this risk. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically evaluate the possible safety effects of HFNO on gastric volume in healthy fasted parturients. Sixty fasted parturients scheduled for elective cesarean delivery were enrolled in an observer-blinded, prospective, interventional study. We used ultrasonography to assess changes of antral cross-sectional area (CSA) and gastric volume before and after a 20-minute treatment with HFNO at a rate of 50 L·min -1 . The primary outcome was the change in gastric volume from before to after HFNO therapy, and the secondary outcome was the distribution of antral grades. In semirecumbent right lateral position, the antral CSA at baseline and after treatment with HFNO was 3.81 (3.01-4.72) cm 2 and 3.79 (3.03-4.54) cm 2 , respectively. The estimated fluid volume at baseline and after treatment with HFNO was 38.51 (33.39-54.62) mL and 39.71 (32.00-52.82) mL, respectively. All participants had either a grade 0 or grade 1 antrum, and most of them had a grade 0 antrum. There was no significant difference in gastric volume and distribution of antral grades before and after HFNO therapy. Gastric air distension was not shown in any of the parturients either at baseline or after treatment with HFNO. Treatment with HFNO for 20 minutes at flow rates up to 50 L·min -1 did not increase gastric volume in term pregnant women breathing spontaneously when evaluated by gastric ultrasonography.",

      "abstract": "High-flow nasal oxygen therapy is increasingly used to improve peri-intubation oxygenation. However, it is unknown whether it may cause or exacerbate insufflation of gas into the stomach. High-flow nasal oxygen therapy is now standard practice in our hospital for adult patients undergoing percutaneous thermal ablation of liver cancer under general anaesthesia with tracheal intubation. We compared gastric gas volumes measured from computed tomography images that had been acquired immediately after intubation in two series of patients: 50 received peri-intubation high-flow nasal oxygen therapy and another 50 received conventional facemask pre-oxygenation and ventilation before intubation and before high-flow nasal oxygen therapy became standard practice in our unit. Median (IQR [range]) gastric gas volume was 24.0 (14.2-59.9 [3-167]) cm3 in the high-flow nasal oxygen therapy group and 23.8 (12.6-38.8 [0-185]) cm3 in the facemask group. There was no difference between the two groups in the volume of gastric gas measured by computed tomography imaging (Mann-Whitney U-test, U = 1136, p = 0.432, n1  = n2  = 50). Our results demonstrate that a small volume of gastric gas is commonly present after induction of anaesthesia, but that the use of peri-intubation high-flow nasal oxygen therapy for pre-oxygenation and during apnoea does not increase this volume compared with conventional facemask pre-oxygenation and ventilation. This is clinically relevant, as high-flow nasal oxygen therapy is increasingly being used in a peri-intubation context and in patients at higher risk of aspiration.",

For group 4 h (n = 46), the patients were asked to be fasted for all types of liquid for more than 4 h, while group 2 h (n = 47) were asked to be fasted for all types of liquid for 2 h before echocardiography. Gastric ultrasound was performed before echocardiography, and CSARLDP was measured. We compared CSARLDP, incidence of at-risk stomach, fasting duration, and the incidence of major (pulmonary aspiration, aspiration pneumonia) and minor complications (nausea, retching, and vomiting, apnea, and bradycardia) between two groups. The mean difference of CSARLDP (group 2 h-group 4 h) was 0.49 (- 0.18 to 1.17) cm2, and it was within the non-inferiority margin (Δ = 2.1 cm2). There was no difference in the incidence of at-risk stomach (P = 0.514). There was no significant difference in the incidence of major and minor complications between the two groups. Two-hour fasting in pediatric patients who need an echocardiography did not increase major and minor complications and CSA significantly.",

This study aimed to evaluate the proportion of children with acute appendicitis who have gastric contents considered to pose a higher risk of pulmonary aspiration. We analysed point-of-care gastric ultrasound data routinely collected in children before emergency appendicectomy in a specialist paediatric hospital over a 30-month period. Based on qualitative and quantitative antral assessment in the supine and right lateral decubitus positions, gastric contents were classified as 'higher-risk' (clear liquid with calculated gastric fluid volume > 0.8 ml.kg-1 , thick liquid or solid) or 'lower-risk' of pulmonary aspiration. The 115 children studied had a mean (SD) age of 11 (3) years; 37 (32%; 95%CI: 24-42%) presented with higher-risk gastric contents, including 15 (13%; 95%CI: 8-21%) with solid/thick liquid contents. Gastric contents could not be determined in 13 children as ultrasound examination was not feasible in the right lateral decubitus position. No cases of pulmonary aspiration occurred. This study shows that gastric ultrasound is feasible in children before emergency appendicectomy. This technique showed a range of gastric content measurements, which could contribute towards defining the risk of pulmonary aspiration.",

      "title": "Effect of preoperative carbohydrate intake on gastric residual volume and pH in gynecologic laparoscopic surgery: A randomized controlled trial.",
      "abstract": "Prolonged fasting before surgery is commonly practiced reducing the risk of pulmonary aspiration during anesthesia induction, but it can cause discomfort and negative recovery process. Preoperative carbohydrate intake, particularly maltodextrin solutions, has emerged as a strategy to enhance recovery while addressing these challenges. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the safety and effectiveness of preoperative maltodextrin intake in 70 patients undergoing gynecological laparoscopic surgery. Participants were divided into 2 groups: a maltodextrin group (n = 35), who consumed a 15% maltodextrin solution (300 mL) 2 hours before surgery, and a fasting group (n = 33), who followed conventional overnight fasting. Key outcomes included gastric residual volume (GRV) and gastric pH, assessed via ultrasound and pH measurement. The mean GRV per body weight was 0.62 ± 0.4 mL/kg in the maltodextrin group and 0.54 ± 0.3 mL/kg in the fasting group (P = .4), showing no significant difference. Gastric pH was 3.45 ± 1.62 in the maltodextrin group and 3.21 ± 1.58 in the fasting group (P = .11). No cases of aspiration or reflux were observed during anesthesia. Preoperative maltodextrin consumption is a safe and effective alternative to traditional fasting, reducing discomfort without compromising patient safety. These findings support the integration of carbohydrate intake into enhanced recovery after surgery protocols to improve perioperative care and outcomes.",

      "abstract": "To explore the application value of dynamic monitoring of gastric residual volume (GRV) in achieving different target energy in severe mechanical ventilation patients. A prospective randomized controlled study was conducted. Forty-two patients with mechanical ventilation admitted to the department of critical care medicine of General Hospital of Ningxia Medical University from July to December 2022 were enrolled. According to the random number table method, patients were divided into GRV guided enteral nutrition by traditional gastric juice pumpback method (control group, 22 patients) and GRV guided enteral nutrition by bedside ultrasound (test group, 20 patients). General data were collected from both groups, and clinical indicators such as hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), neutrophil percentage (Neut%), procalcitonin (PCT), absolute lymphocytes (LYM), prealbumin (PA), and retinol-binding protein (RBP) were dynamically observed. Inflammation, infection, immunity, nutritional indicators, and the incidence of reflux/aspiration, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) were compared between the two groups, and further compared the proportion of patients with respectively to reach the target energy 25%, 50%, and 70% on days 1, 3, and 5 of initiated enteral nutrition. (1) There were no significant differences in gender, age, body mass index (BMI), duration of mechanical ventilation, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA), severe nutritional risk score (NUTRIC) at admission between the two groups, indicating comparability. (2) On day 1 of initiated enteral nutrition, there were no significant differences in infection, inflammation, immunity and nutrition indicators between the two groups. On day 3 of initiated enteral nutrition, the hs-CRP in the test group was lower than that control group, LYM and PA were higher than those control group [hs-CRP (mg/L): 129.60±75.18 vs. 185.20±63.74, LYM: 1.00±0.84 vs. 0.60±0.41, PA (mg/L): 27.30±3.66 vs. 22.30±2.55, all P < 0.05]. On day 5 of initiated enteral nutrition, the hs-CRP, Neut%, PCT in the test group were lower than those control group, LYM and PA were higher than those control group [hs-CRP (mg/L): 101.70±54.32 vs. 148.40±36.35, Neut%: (85.50±7.66)% vs. (92.90±6.01)%, PCT (μg/L): 0.7 (0.3, 2.7) vs. 3.6 (1.2, 7.5), LYM: 1.00±0.68 vs. 0.50±0.38, PA (mg/L): 27.10±4.57 vs. 20.80 ± 3.51, all P < 0.05]. There were no significantly differences in IL-6 and RBP between the two groups at different time points. (3) The proportion of 50% and 70% of achieved target energy in the test group on day 3, day 5 of initiated enteral nutrition were higher than those of the control group (70.0% vs. 36.4%, 70.0% vs. 36.4%, both P < 0.05).

Dynamic monitoring of GRV by bedside ultrasound can accurately improve the proportion of 50% of achieved target energy on day 3 and 75% on day 5 in severe mechanical ventilation patients, improve the patient's inflammation, immune and nutritional status, and can prevent the occurrence of reflux/aspiration and VAP.",

      "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) use is rapidly increasing in the US, driven by its expanded approval for weight management in addition to hyperglycemia management in patients with type 2 diabetes. The perioperative safety of these medications, particularly with aspiration risk under anesthesia, is uncertain. To assess the association between GLP-1 RA use and prevalence of increased residual gastric content (RGC), a major risk factor for aspiration under anesthesia, using gastric ultrasonography. This cross-sectional study prospectively enrolled patients from a large, tertiary, university-affiliated hospital from June 6 through July 12, 2023. Participants followed preprocedural fasting guidelines before an elective procedure under anesthesia. Patients with altered gastric anatomy (eg, from previous gastric surgery), pregnancy, recent trauma (<1 month), or an inability to lie in the right lateral decubitus position for gastric ultrasonography were excluded. Use of a once-weekly GLP-1 RA. The primary outcome was the presence of increased RGC, defined by the presence of solids, thick liquids, or more than 1.5 mL/kg of clear liquids on gastric ultrasonography. Analysis was adjusted for confounders using augmented inverse probability of treatment weighting, a propensity score-based technique. Secondarily, the association between the duration of drug interruption and the prevalence of increased RGC was explored. Among the 124 participants (median age, 56 years [IQR, 46-65 years]; 75 [60%] female), the prevalence of increased RGC was 56% (35 of 62) in patients with GLP-1 RA use (exposure group) compared with 19% (12 of 62) in patients who were not taking a GLP-1 RA drug (control group). After adjustment for confounding, GLP-1 RA use was associated with a 30.5% (95% CI, 9.9%-51.2%) higher prevalence of increased RGC (adjusted prevalence ratio, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.23-4.97). There was no association between the duration of GLP-1 RA interruption and the prevalence of increased RGC (adjusted odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.65-1.14). Use of a GLP-1 RA was independently associated with increased RGC on preprocedural gastric ultrasonography. The findings suggest that the preprocedural fasting duration suggested by current guidelines may be inadequate in this group of patients at increased risk of aspiration under anesthesia.",

      "title": "The role of gastric ultrasound in anaesthesia for emergency surgery: A review and clinical guidance.",
      "abstract": "The timing and technique of anaesthesia are challenging in patients with a history of recent food intake. The presence of gastric contents increases the risk of aspiration, potentially resulting in acute lung injury, pneumonia, or death. Delayed gastric emptying complicates the estimation of aspiration risk. Surprisingly, there are no fasting guidelines for emergency surgery. Point-of-care gastric ultrasound is a time-efficient, cost-efficient and accurate bedside tool with which to estimate residual gastric content and to guide decision-making in airway management and timing of general anaesthesia. This review summarises the prevailing concepts of ultrasound-guided gastric content assessment for emergency surgery. Medline and Embase databases were searched for studies using ultrasound for the evaluation of gastric content in adults scheduled for emergency surgery. Five prospective observational studies representing 793 emergency surgery patients showed that the incidence of 'full stomach' was between 18 and 56% at the time of induction. Risk factors for a full stomach before emergency surgery were abdominal or gynaecological/obstetric surgery, high body mass index and morphine consumption. No correlation between preoperative fasting time and the presence of a full/empty stomach was found. No deaths due to aspiration were reported. The preoperative presence of gastric content before emergency surgery is high and the estimates used for clinical management are unreliable. This review demonstrates that gastric ultrasound is a valuable tool for evaluating gastric content. A flow chart for medical decision-making using gastric ultrasound before emergency surgery was developed to assist in clinical decision-making. The validity and practical applicability should be assessed in future studies.",

      "abstract": "Purpose The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) preoperative fasting recommendations regarding fruit juice with pulp is unclear. In addition, it is debatable whether orange juice without pulp should be treated as a clear liquid. Our objective is to determine the gastric emptying time of orange juice with and without pulp. Methods This is an observational study of gastric emptying time using point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS). Thirty-five adult volunteers were enrolled in this study. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, diabetes, body mass index > 40 kg/m2, previous lower esophageal or upper abdominal surgery, hiatal hernia, and upper gastrointestinal bleed. The study was carried out on three separate days for each volunteer. After fasting a minimum of 8 h, the volunteers were asked to drink 240 ml of water on day 1, orange juice without pulp on day 2, and orange juice with pulp on day 3. Gastric volumes were estimated using gastric antrum cross-sectional area at fasting state, and then 30, 60, 90 120, 180, and 240 min after drinking until the gastric volume returned to baseline. Results A gastric volume of 1.5 mL/kg was defined as a baseline. All subjects' gastric volume returned to baseline 90 min after drinking water. More than 97% of the subjects who drank orange juice without pulp and 93.9% of the subjects who drank orange juice with pulp reached a gastric volume of less than 1.5 mL/kg after 2 h. All subjects' gastric volume returned to baseline 3 h after drinking orange juice with pulp. Conclusions Orange juice without pulp can be treated as a clear liquid in a majority of patients who do not have conditions that would cause delayed gastric emptying. Orange juice with pulp required 3 h to empty.",

      "abstract": "Point-of-care ultrasonography can estimate gastric contents and volume to assess the risk of pulmonary aspiration; however, its use in infants has not been well validated. We aimed to develop a predictive model for estimating gastric fluid volume using ultrasonography in infants. This prospective observational study enrolled 200 infants (≤12 months) undergoing general anaesthesia. After anaesthetic induction, while preserving spontaneous respiration, we measured gastric antral cross-sectional area using ultrasonography in both the supine and right lateral decubitus positions. We then suctioned the gastric content and measured its volume. The primary outcome was development of a gastric fluid volume prediction model with multiple regression analysis. Agreement between the predicted volume and the suctioned volume was evaluated using a Bland-Altman plot. Overall, 192 infants were included in the final analysis. Pearson correlation analysis showed that the gastric antral cross-sectional area in the supine (P<0.001; correlation coefficient: 0.667) and right lateral decubitus (P<0.001; correlation coefficient: 0.845) positions and qualitative antral grade (P<0.001; correlation coefficient: 0.581) correlated with suctioned volume. We developed a predictive model: predicted volume (ml)=-3.7+6.5 × (right lateral decubitus cross-sectional area [cm2])-3.9 (supine cross-sectional area [cm2])+1.7 × grade (P<0.01). When comparing the predicted volume and suctioned volume, the mean bias was 0.01 ml kg-1 and the limit of agreement was -0.58 to 0.62 ml kg-1.

      "abstract": "A 3-year-old castrated male golden retriever was presented for evaluation of 2 cutaneous masses along the abdominal midline and a 6-month history of progressive lethargy and inappetence. Two years earlier, the dog underwent a gastrotomy to retrieve a foreign object and recovered uneventfully. Fluid aspirated from the lesions was culture-negative for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial growth. Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated a large intra-abdominal mass with apparent communication with the cutaneous lesion, along with gossypiboma from the previous laparotomy. Neoplasia or a sterile abscess were suspected. Exploratory laparotomy was performed and revealed that the intra-abdominal mass was adhered to the abdominal midline and the greater curvature of the stomach. The masses and affected portions of the body wall and stomach were resected and histopathology was consistent with phaeohyphomycosis. Antifungal therapy with voriconazole (6.3 mg/kg, PO, q12h) was initiated. At 1 mo after surgery, all clinical signs had resolved. At 4 and 7 mo after surgery, the dog continued to thrive despite 2 small masses, seen on abdominal ultrasound imaging on the intra-abdominal midline, suggestive of reoccurrence. Continued voriconazole therapy was administered in lieu of further surgical excision. One year after surgery, the masses were no longer present on ultrasonographic evaluation. Phaeohyphomycosis is a rare, opportunistic fungal infection that typically affects the dermis and subcutis of immunocompromised dogs. This is the first report of phaeohyphomycosis in an immunocompetent dog and involving the dermis, subcutis, and abdominal viscera. Key clinical message: This case adds to the very limited literature on phaeohyphomycosis in dogs and illustrates that surgery could be a risk factor for infection, even in dogs with no known underlying disease or immunodeficiency.",

      "abstract": "Aspiration pneumonitis remains a dreaded complication that may lead to almost 9% of anaesthesia-related deaths. The presence of gastric contents has always been a contributing factor to an increased risk of aspiration. Preoperative gastric ultrasound has been suggested as a modality for determining residual volume in special populations and conditions. We conducted an observational study to determine the gastric residual volume in preoperative patients of elective surgery with gastric ultrasound and to study its correlation with patient factors. We enrolled 411 patients in the age group of 18-80 with ASA-PS I and II having BMI less than 35 kg/m2. Patients with prior gastrointestinal surgery and parturients were excluded from the present study. Gastric antrum in both supine and right lateral decubitus positions was measured using USG in the immediate preoperative period, and gastric residual volume was calculated, which was subsequently correlated with various patient factors. On qualitative assessment, 97 and 118 patients were observed to have distended stomachs in the supine and right lateral decubitus positions, respectively. On quantitative assessment, 336 had safe GRV, 60 patients were classified as having a low risk of aspiration (GRV < 1.5 ml/kg) while 13 had a high risk of aspiration (> 1.5 ml/kg). Eight patients with a fasting duration of more than ten hours and five who fasted between 6 and 10 h had a gastric residual volume of more than 1.5 ml/h. Patients who were premedicated with histamine blockers had a statistically significant higher antral cross-sectional area (p-value - 0.022*) and GRV (p-value - 0.018*) in the right lateral decubitus position compared to patients who had taken proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). As BMI increased, there was a statistically significant (p-value < 0.001) increase in mean antral CSA in both supine and right lateral decubitus positions. There was a statistically significant association found between type 2 diabetes (p-value 0.045*) with antral grade. Patients can have significant residual volume (> 1.5 ml/kg) despite adequate fasting, and preoperative gastric ultrasound can help in assessing the same and guiding perioperative airway management. PPIs are more effective in reducing gastric residual volume as compared to histamine blockers. Patients with a BMI of more than 30 and type 2 diabetes mellitus have significant correlation with increased gastric residual volume mandating preoperative gastric ultrasound assessment for effective management. Patients with BMI over 30 and type 2 diabetes may benefit from POCGUS to guide perioperative airway management by stratifying GRV.

      "title": "Gastric emptying time of two different quantities of clear fluids in children: A double-blinded randomized controlled study.",
      "abstract": "Perioperative pulmonary aspiration risk increases with increased preoperative gastric volume; hence traditionally, healthy children are kept fasted overnight before surgery. Current guidelines recommend 2-h clear fluids fasting prior to anesthesia. However, emerging evidence favors allowing 3 ml/kg clear fluids up to 1-h before anesthesia. We compared the gastric volume and gastric emptying time after ingestion of 3 ml/kg and 5 ml/kg of clear fluids. The present study enrolled 44 children, aged between 6 and 14 years. On the day of surgery, baseline gastric volume was estimated using ultrasound and patients were randomly allocated into two groups of equal number, that is, Group 3 and Group 5 (patients received 3 ml/kg and 5 ml/kg 5% Dextrose respectively). Repeated gastric ultrasound was performed at every 5 min until the gastric volume reached baseline levels. The primary objective of the study was to compare gastric emptying time. Secondary objectives included comparison of antral cross-sectional area and gastric volume. The demographic profile, preoperative fasting duration for clear fluids, and baseline gastric volume were comparable between groups. In both groups, compared to baseline the antral cross-sectional area and gastric volume increased significantly following fluid ingestion and then decreased exponentially to reach baseline within 1-h. The median (IQR) (range) gastric emptying time (minutes) [35.0 (28.8, 40.0) (20.0-45.0) in group 3 and 40.0 (28.8, 45.0) (20.0-50.0) in group 5] and emptying half-time (minutes) [17.0 (15.7, 21.5) (14.4-24.0) in group 3 and 18.6 (16.0, 22.0) (15.1-23.8) in group 5] were comparable [median difference -5 (95% CI -7.8 to 2.1) and -1.5 (95% CI -2.3 to 1.0), respectively] (p = .16 and p = .44, respectively). As the gastric volume returned to baseline within 1-h even after ingesting 5 ml/kg clear fluids, the preoperative fasting time can be reduced to 1-h and healthy children undergoing elective procedure can be safely allowed to drink up to 5 ml/kg clear fluids.",

      "abstract": "Interpretation of gastric ultrasound relies on the use of a clinical algorithm that combines qualitative analysis of the gastric antrum contents with the calculation of the volume of fluid contents. This reference method may be difficult to apply in the parturient. We therefore aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of a simple qualitative assessment in the supine position for the diagnosis of high-risk gastric contents in the parturient. We also assessed the diagnostic accuracy of a composite scale and another clinical algorithm based on a mathematical model different to that used in the reference method. Prospective observational cohort study. University hospital, Lyon, France. Adult women admitted to the delivery room. Qualitative and quantitative gastric ultrasound examination within the first hour following admission. With respect to the reference method, the diagnostic accuracy of a simple qualitative assessment for the diagnosis of high-risk gastric contents was assessed. The diagnostic accuracy of a composite scale and another clinical algorithm, and the agreement between each approach were also assessed. A total of 235 parturients were included and analyzed. The simple qualitative assessment led to conclusive ultrasound assessment in 233 (99%) women, while the reference method led to conclusive assessment in 213 (91%) women (P < 0.05). The sensitivity and the specificity of the simple qualitative assessment were 97% (95%CI: 93 to 99%) and 96% (95%CI: 90 to 99%), respectively. These were not significantly different from those of the composite scale and the clinical algorithm. The four approaches showed almost perfect agreement with each other. These results suggest that simple qualitative assessment may be useful in clinical practice to help the anesthesiologist in the assessment of gastric contents status and risk of aspiration.",

One of their key mechanisms of action is thought to be delaying gastric emptying. This review explores the perioperative risks associated with GLP-1RAs use, particularly the increased risk of gastric content retention and pulmonary aspiration. Current evidence suggests that patients on GLP-1RAs should be considered at risk for having a full stomach during surgery. Recommendations include careful assessment of medication details, additional monitoring, and preventive measures such as pre-anesthesia gastric ultrasound and rapid sequence induction. Further research is needed to establish comprehensive guidelines for the perioperative management of GLP-1RAs users. Adverse events related to GLP-1RAs use during anesthesia should be thoroughly documented, which is essential to inform future guidelines and to enhance patient safety.",

      "abstract": "Enhanced recovery after surgery advocates that consuming carbohydrates two hours before anesthesia is beneficial to the patient's recovery. Patients with diabetes are prone to delayed gastric emptying. Different guidelines for preoperative carbohydrate consumption in patients with diabetes remain controversial due to concerns about the risk of regurgitation, aspiration and hyperglycemia. Ultrasonic gastric volume (GV) assessment and blood glucose monitoring can comprehensively evaluate the safety and feasibility of preoperative carbohydrate intake in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. To evaluate the impact of preoperative carbohydrate loading on GV before anesthesia induction in T2D patients. Patients with T2D receiving surgery under general anesthesia from December 2019 to December 2020 were included. A total of 78 patients were randomly allocated to 4 groups receiving 0, 100, 200, or 300 mL of carbohydrate loading 2 h before anesthesia induction. Gastric volume per unit weight (GV/W), Perlas grade, changes in blood glucose level, and risk of reflux and aspiration were evaluated before anesthesia induction. No significant difference was found in GV/W among the groups before anesthesia induction (P > 0.05). The number of patients with Perlas grade II and GV/W > 1.5 mL/kg did not differ among the groups (P > 0.05). Blood glucose level increased by > 2 mmol/L in patients receiving 300 mL carbohydrate drink, which was significantly higher than that in groups 1 and 2 (P < 0.05). Preoperative carbohydrate loading < 300 mL 2 h before induction of anesthesia in patients with T2D did not affect GV or increase the risk of reflux and aspiration. Blood glucose levels did not change significantly with preoperative carbohydrate loading of < 200 mL. However, 300 mL carbohydrate loading may increase blood glucose levels in patients with T2D before induction of anesthesia.",

      "abstract": "Although gastric reserve volume (GRV) is a surrogate marker of gastrointestinal dysfunction and feeding intolerance, there is ambiguity in its estimation due to problems associated with its measurement. Introduction of point-of-care ultrasound as a tool for anesthetists kindled interest in its use for GRV estimation. In this prospective observational study, we recruited 57 critically ill patients and analyzed 586 samples of GRV obtained by both ultrasonography (USG) and manual aspiration. The analysis showed that USG-guided GRV was significantly correlated (r=0.788, P<0.001) and in positive agreement with manual aspiration based on Bland-Altman plot, with a mean difference of 8.50±14.84 (95% confidence interval, 7.389-9.798). The upper and lower limits of agreement were 37.7 and -20.5, respectively, within the ±1.96 standard deviation (P<0.001). The respective sensitivity and positive predictive value, specificity and negative predictive value, and area under the curve of USG for feeding intolerance were 66.67%, 98.15%, and 0.82%, with 96.49% diagnostic accuracy. Ultrasonographic estimation of GRV was positively, significantly correlated and in agreement with the manual aspiration method and estimated feeding intolerance earlier. Routine use of gastric USG could avoid clinical situations where feeding status is unclear and there is high risk of aspiration and could become a standard practice of critical care.",

This review highlights physiologic changes of pregnancy and presents clinical recommendations based on recent literature to guide anesthetic management for the pregnant patient undergoing nonobstetric surgery. Nearly every anesthetic technique has been safely used in pregnant patients. Although it is difficult to eliminate confounding factors, exposure to anesthetics could endanger fetal brain development. Perioperative fetal monitoring decisions require an obstetric consult based on anticipated maternal and fetal concerns. Given the limitations of fasting guidelines, bedside gastric ultrasound is useful in assessing aspiration risk in pregnant patients. Although there is concern about appropriateness of sugammadex for neuromuscular blockade reversal due its binding to progesterone, preliminary literature supports its safety. These recommendations will equip anesthesiologists to provide safe care for the pregnant patient and fetus undergoing nonobstetric surgery.",

      "abstract": "Pulmonary aspiration is one of the most important complications in anesthesiology. Assessment of gastric content by ultrasound is a good method to quantify gastric volume and to determine the risk of intraoperative pulmonary aspiration. The aim of this study is to determine the accuracy of the gastric ultrasonography in the qualitative analysis of gastric content, mainly in the analysis of small amounts of liquid content. Gastric ultrasound was performed to 36 patients before upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGI), making two longitudinal scans at the epigastric level, one in supine position and the other in right lateral decubitus position, measuring two diameters and the area of the gastric antrum and assessing the content characteristics determining whether it was an empty stomach or contained fluid or solid content. Subsequently, the ultrasound findings were compared with UGI findings. Gastric areas were analyzed by the trace and the lengths of the craniocaudal and anteroposterior axes concluding that there are no significant differences between the two methods. No statistically significant difference was found between UGI and US assessment technics. No statistically significant difference was found between the estimated volume by UGI and US. Though our study has some limitations, qualitative analysis of gastric content using ultrasound followed by endoscopy enabled the conclusion that there are no differences in the qualitative assessment regarding these two techniques, supporting the important role of point-of-care gastric ultrasound (POCGUS) in the assessment of pulmonary aspiration risk by the anesthesiologist in the perioperative period.",

Anaesthetists must be aware of a potentially dangerous side effect of the drug: decreased gastric emptying. This is caused by effects on gastric smooth muscle, mediated by the vagal afferent nerves. This is especially relevant in the peri-operative setting where pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents is a recognised complication. Here, we report two cases of peri-operative regurgitation of gastric contents in patients taking semaglutide. A patient taking semaglutide may have a full stomach despite compliance with routine pre-operative fasting guidelines. We consider how to manage patients receiving glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist therapy in the peri-operative period, including identifying those at high risk of regurgitation. Precautions such as rapid sequence induction and tracheal intubation can be used, but gastric ultrasound may also be useful in the pre-operative environment to help identify patients at high risk of aspiration.",

      "abstract": "Pulmonary aspiration syndrome remains a significant complication of general anesthesia, particularly in unfasted patients. Gastric point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) allows for both qualitative and quantitative assessment of gastric content, providing a safe and reliable method to assess gastric emptying and reduce the risk of aspiration during general anesthesia. The survey was distributed to Belgian certified anesthesiologists and trainees between April 2020 and June 2021. Participants received a simulated clinical case of a patient at risk of gastric aspiration, created and approved by two certified anesthesiologists trained to perform gastric POCUS. The objectives of this study were to assess recognition of high-risk clinical situations for gastric aspiration, awareness of the gastric POCUS and its indications, and knowledge of the technical and practical conditions of the procedure among respondents trained in the technique. Furthermore, the study assessed the state of training in gastric POCUS, the desire for education, and the practical availability of ultrasound equipment. The survey used conditional branching to ensure unbiased responses to POCUS-related questions. It included multiple-choice questions, quantitative variables, and 5-point Likert scales. The margin of error was calculated using Daniel's formula, corrected for a finite population. The survey was conducted among 323 anesthesiologists. Only 20.8% (27) recognized the risk of a full stomach based on the patient's history. Anesthesiologists who recognized the indication for gastric POCUS and were trained in the procedure demonstrated good recall of the practical conditions for performing the procedure and interpreting the results. Only 13.08% (31) of all respondents had received training in gastric POCUS, while 72.57% (172) expressed interest in future training. Furthermore, 80.17% (190) of participants had access to adequate ultrasound equipment and 78.90% (187) supported teaching gastric POCUS to anesthesia trainees. This survey offers insight into the epidemiology, clinical recognition, knowledge, and utilization of gastric POCUS among Belgian anesthesia professionals. The results emphasize the significance of proper equipment and training to ensure the safe and effective implementation of gastric POCUS in anesthesia practice. Additional efforts should focus on improving training and promoting the integration of gastric POCUS into daily clinical practice.",

This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of measuring the gastric antrum cross-sectional area (CSA) to supply a novel clinical diagnostic reference value in patients with dyspepsia. Patients with dyspepsia undergoing elective gastroscopy were included. The Perlas qualitative 0-2 grading scale score was determined before the operation. The anteroposterior diameter (D1) and craniocaudal diameter (D2) between gastric antrum serosal surfaces were measured perpendicular to each other in the supine and right lateral decubitus (RLD) positions. CSA values in the supine position and RLD position were determined. Gastric contents were endoscopically suctioned with the volumes measured and noted as actual gastric volume. Multiple regression analysis was used to fit a mathematical model for estimating the gastric volume. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to determine the accuracy of RLD CSA to detect gastric volumes of > 0.8 ml/kg. A total of 117 patients were enrolled and divided into a functional dyspepsia (FD) group and an organic dyspepsia group according to gastroscopy findings. For a gastric volume of > 0.8 ml/kg, cut-off values for FD and organic dyspepsia were 6.7 cm2 and 10.0 cm2, respectively. Two new modified mathematical models were derived to predict an estimated gastric volume for FD and organic dyspepsia: volume = 3.93 × RLD CSA - 0.47 × age; and volume = 6.15 × RLD CSA - 0.61 × age. We used the cut-off value of the antral area for the fast diagnosis of gastric volumes in patients with dyspepsia, which may assist clinicians in identifying patients at risk of aspiration. www.chictr.org.cn ( CHICTR-DDD-17010871 ); registered 15 March 2017.",

      "abstract": "An 83-year-old male underwent three transgastric punctures with endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration for the examination of a pancreatic body tumor. After a diagnosis of resectable pancreatic cancer and undergoing distal pancreatectomy, the patient was administered postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with oral S-1 for 6 months, and carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels were bimonthly evaluated. Carbohydrate antigen 19-9 levels continually increased to 4638.1 U/mL at 45 months post-fine-needle aspiration. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided showed a 25 mm low-echoic, irregularly shaped, and heterogeneous tumor with clear margins protruding from the mucosa outside the gastric wall, and biopsy confirmed adenocarcinoma. Since the immunostaining findings of the specimen matched those of the previously resected specimen, needle tract seeding (NTS) due to puncture of the pancreatic cancer was identified as the cause. After a pylorus-preserving gastrectomy at 46 months post-fine-needle aspiration, postoperative chemotherapy initiation, comprising gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, was initiated; however, the patient died despite these interventions as he developed multiple peritoneal dissemination. Although rare, the incidence of NTS will increase in the future owing to the expected extended survival in post-pancreatic cancer resection cases. We suggest regular upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound-guided evaluations for patients who are at risk for NTS can facilitate early detection. Furthermore, it is extremely relevant to share experiences of encountered NTS cases in practice and extend knowledge of its varying endoscopic appearances.",

      "abstract": "The aspiration of gastric residual volume through the gastric tube increases the risk of feed interruption episodes, prolongs the time needed to achieve full enteral feeding and regain birth weight, and may potentially damage the gastric mucous. This study aimed to develop a point-of-care ultrasound-based model to calculate gastric residual volume in preterm infants. This observational study enrolled 100 preterm infants who fed by gastric tube. The collected data included general characteristics of the preterm infants, the antral cross-sectional area in the right lateral position within 30 min prior to feeding and the gastric residue volume measured through gastric tube. A linear regression analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between the antral cross-sectional area and the aspirated gastric residual volume, with the calculation of the Pearson correlation coefficient. A stepwise linear multiple regression was employed to model the relationship between the suctioned residual volume and the parameters under consideration. Subsequently, we utilized the Bland-Altman plot to assess the agreement between the gastric residual volume measured by aspiration and our model, respectively. Overall, 89 preterm infants were included in the final analysis. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a significant correlation between the gastric antral cross-sectional area in the right lateral decubitus position and the suctioned volume (P < 0.001; correlation coefficient: 0.905). We developed an ultrasound calculation model as follows: Volume (ml)= -3.74 + 9.08 × Gastric Antral Cross-Sectional Area (measured in the right lateral decubitus position) (cm2). When comparing the ultrasound calculated volume and suctioned volume, the mean was 0.05 ml kg-1 and the limit of consistency was - 1.59 to 1.69 ml kg-1 between the ultrasound calculated volume and suctioned one. The use of ultrasound to assess gastric residual volume (GRV) offers a promising alternative to gastric tube suction, potentially reducing associated complications and enhancing enteral nutrition management in preterm infants. Our study represents a pioneering effort in the development of a point-of-care ultrasound-based calculation model for non-invasive GRV assessment in this vulnerable population.",

      "abstract": "Gastric retention is a common complication in individuals receiving enteral nutrition (EN) via a nasogastric tube, increasing the risk of aspiration pneumonia and causing unnecessary interruptions in nutritional support. Given its clinical significance, establishing effective, evidence-based, and standardized management strategies is essential for bettering patient outcomes and mitigating complications. This review systematically synthesized the diagnostic criteria, assessment methods, influencing factors, management procedures, and intervention strategies for gastric retention in EN patients. Although no universal consensus exists regarding gastric residual volume (GRV) thresholds, evidence indicates that EN can continue at high GRV levels in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Bedside ultrasound emerged as a non-invasive, and precise method GRV assessment, offering potential to standardize clinical practice. Key risk factors for gastric retention include neurological disorders and EN infusion rates exceeding 100 mL/h.
