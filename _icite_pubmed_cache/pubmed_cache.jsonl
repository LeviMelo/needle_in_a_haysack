{"pmid": 40720602, "title": "Intercostal Nerve Cryoablation During Pectus Excavatum Surgery for Postoperative Pain Management: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.", "abstract": "The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature-reported outcomes of CRYO compared to standard of care without CRYO (non-CRYO) after PEx repair. Surgical repair of pectus excavatum (PEx) via the Nuss or Ravitch procedures is associated with substantial postoperative pain. Intercostal nerve cryoablation (CRYO) performed during the primary surgical repair has been adopted as a non-opioid modality for pain management. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and using additional online approaches to identify comparative studies of patients undergoing the Nuss or Ravitch procedure for PEx repair with CRYO versus non-CRYO between years 2014-24. Meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively evaluate primary outcomes of hospital length of stay (LOS) and opioid consumption. Secondary outcomes were hospital costs and complications, summarized qualitatively. Of 178 studies, 32 comparative studies encompassing 13,103 patients were included; 28% (n=3,620) received CRYO. Random effects meta-analyses demonstrated a significantly shortened LOS by 1.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.12, -1.42) and a significant reduction in inpatient and outpatient opioid consumption with CRYO by 186 morphine mg equivalents (MME) (95% CI: -262.26, -109.08) and 147 MME (95% CI: -255.72, -38.26), respectively. Complications with CRYO were either decreased or similar between groups and resolved over time. Hospital costs were similar. This systematic review suggests CRYO during PEx repair is associated with a significantly shorter hospital LOS, as well as decreased opioid consumption both in the hospital and after discharge. Complications were infrequent and time-limited. Copyright © 2025 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.", "mesh": []}

This procedure is associated with significant postoperative pain, which is the dominant factor determining the duration of hospitalization. To date, a multitude of analgesic modalities are used, however, the most effective is to be corroborated. The aim of this study is to systematically evaluate and compare all available analgesic modalities for pain management after minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum through a network meta-analysis. Electronic scientific databases were systematically searched. Articles were eligible for inclusion when designed as a comparative study evaluating perioperative pain management techniques for patients undergoing minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum and where length of hospitalization was reported as an outcome. Data concerning length of hospitalization were extracted and submitted for network meta-analysis. Thirty-nine studies were included, enrolling 4241 patients. Through a network meta-analysis intercostal nerve cryoablation with an adjunct analgesic intervention (e.g., intercostal nerve block or patient controlled analgesia) showed a statistically significant reduction in the length of hospitalization ranging from 0.9 days (95 % confidence interval (CI): -1.7 to -0.1) when compared to locoregional blocks with an adjunct analgesic intervention to 2.5 days (95 % CI: -3.7 to -1.3) when compared to thoracic epidural analgesia. Regarding postoperative pain management after minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum, intercostal nerve cryoablation with adjunct analgesic intervention is more effective in terms of length of hospitalization compared to other forms of analgesia.

We examined pain control after intercostal nerve block with or without cryoablation of the intercostal nerves. This was a randomized study (NCT05348447) of adults scheduled for a minimally invasive thoracic procedure. Each intercostal space near the incision site was injected with lidocaine and bupivacaine with epinephrine (standard of care). The cryoanalgesia group also had 5 to 6 intercostal nerves ablated. The primary outcome was the amount of narcotics (in morphine milligram equivalents taken during the postoperative hospital stay and the first 2 weeks postdischarge. Secondary outcomes were incentive spirometry volume and pain scores in the hospital and pain and neuropathy scores at 2 weeks. Our final cohort contained 103 patients (52 standard of care and 51 cryoanalgesia). There were no differences between the treatment groups in morphine milligram equivalents administered during the hospital stay (44.9 vs 38.4 mg), total morphine milligram equivalents at 2 weeks (108.8 vs 95.2 mg), or pain assessed by visual analog scale on postoperative day 1 (3.8 and 3.3), postoperative day 2 (2 and 3.5), or 2 weeks (2 and 3.5) for standard of care and cryoanalgesia group patients, respectively. The decrease in incentive spirometry during the postoperative period was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Patients in the cryoanalgesia group had higher neuropathy scores (8 vs 13; P = .019) 2 weeks after surgery. In this randomized study, cryoanalgesia did not decrease postoperative pain or narcotic requirements. Cryoanalgesia increased neuropathic pain 2 weeks after surgery.

The aim of this study is to review the use and patient outcomes of intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) during PE repair reported in the literature. An unfunded literature search using PubMed identifying articles discussing INC during PE repair from 1946 to 1 July 2023 was performed. Articles were included if they discussed patient outcomes with INC use during PE repair. Articles were excluded if they were reviews/meta-analyses, editorials, or not available in English. Each article was reviewed for bias by analyzing the study methods, data analysis, patient selection, and patient follow-up. Articles comparing outcomes of INC were considered significant if p-value was <0.05. A total of 34 articles were included in this review that described INC use during pectus repair. Most supported a decreased hospital length of stay and opioid use with INC. Overall, INC was associated with fewer short-term and long-term complications. However, the researchers reported varied results of total hospital costs with the use of INC. The review was limited by a paucity of prospective studies and low number of patients who received INC.

Considering its postulated mechanism of action, we encouraged cryoanalgesia as an effective method for postrepair pain management and a possibly superior alternative. A randomized, single-blind clinical trial was tested on patients undergoing pectus excavatum (PE) repair in March and December 2022. Among 101 patients, consenting study participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: cryoanalgesia (group C, n = 24) or noncryoanalgesia (group N, n = 24). Group N received conventional pain management. Comparing the results, pain levels were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS-R for resting and VAS-D for dynamic) and the total rescue analgesic consumption was determined. Intrathoracic cryoablation was performed bilaterally on the fourth and seventh intercostal nerves using a cryoprobe at -80°C for 2 minutes. The two groups had similar baseline-patient characteristics; however, group C had a longer mean operative time (159 vs. 125 minutes, p < 0.01) and experienced significantly less pain throughout the postoperative course, with VAS at 6 hours (5.38 vs. 7.04, p < 0.01) and 48 hours (3.17 vs. 5.67, p < 0.01). Cryoanalgesia improved postoperative pain control at rest and during movement following PE repair. However, the outcome was less favorable than expected because the VAS was greater than 4 (moderate pain), although after a day or two, it decreased to lower levels (VAS < 4) in the cyro group. Considering its extra invasiveness and instrumentation, a routine cryoanalgesia procedure for pectus surgery is yet to be determined. Thieme.

Recently, intercostal nerve cryoablation has been proposed as an alternative method with long-acting pain control and shortened hospitalization. The subsequent objective was to systematically review the outcomes of intercostal nerve cryoablation in comparison to thoracic epidural after the Nuss procedure. Six scientific databases were searched. Data concerning the length of hospital stay, operative time and postoperative opioid usage were extracted. If possible, data were submitted to meta-analysis using the mean of differences, random-effects model with inverse variance method and I2 test for heterogeneity. Four observational and 1 randomized study were included, enrolling a total of 196 patients. Meta-analyses demonstrated a significantly shortened length of hospital stay [mean difference -2.91 days; 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.68 to -2.15; P < 0.001] and increased operative time (mean difference 40.91 min; 95% CI 14.42-67.40; P < 0.001) for cryoablation. Both analyses demonstrated significant heterogeneity (both I2 = 91%; P < 0.001). Qualitative analysis demonstrated the amount of postoperative opioid usage to be significantly lower for cryoablation in 3 out of 4 reporting studies. Intercostal nerve cryoablation during the Nuss procedure may be an attractive alternative to thoracic epidural analgesia, resulting in shortened hospitalization.

We hypothesized that intercostal nerve cryoablation during the Nuss procedure reduces hospital length of stay (LOS) compared to thoracic epidural analgesia. This randomized clinical trial evaluated 20 consecutive patients undergoing the Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum between May 2016 and March 2018. Patients were randomized evenly via closed-envelope method to receive either cryoanalgesia or thoracic epidural analgesia. Patients and physicians were blinded to study arm until immediately preoperatively. Single institution, UCSF-Benioff Children's Hospital. 20 consecutive patients were recruited from those scheduled for the Nuss procedure. Exclusion criteria were age < 13 years, chest wall anomaly other than pectus excavatum, previous repair or other thoracic surgery, and chronic use of pain medications. Primary outcome was postoperative LOS. Secondary outcomes included total operative time, total/daily opioid requirement, inpatient/outpatient pain score, and complications. Primary outcome data were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U-test for nonparametric continuous variables. Other continuous variables were analyzed by two-tailed t-test, while categorical data were compared via Chi-squared test, with alpha = 0.05 for significance. 20 patients were randomized to receive either cryoablation (n = 10) or thoracic epidural (n = 10). Mean operating room time was 46.5 min longer in the cryoanalgesia group (p = 0.0001). Median LOS decreased by 2 days in patients undergoing cryoablation, to 3 days from 5 days (Mann-Whitney U, p = 0.0001). Cryoablation patients required significantly less inpatient opioid analgesia with a mean decrease of 416 mg oral morphine equivalent per patient (p = 0.0001), requiring 52%-82% fewer milligrams on postoperative days 1-3 (p < 0.01 each day). There was no difference in mean pain score between the groups at any point postoperatively, up to one year, and no increased incidence of neuropathic pain in the cryoablation group. No complications were noted in the cryoablation group; among patients with epidurals, one patient experienced a symptomatic pneumothorax and another had urinary retention. Intercostal nerve cryoablation during the Nuss procedure decreases hospital length of stay and opiate requirement versus thoracic epidural analgesia, while offering equivalent pain control.

After implementation of cryoanalgesia at our institution, we had several cases of delayed postoperative pneumothorax. The purpose of this study was to critically evaluate the complications and efficacy of cryoanalgesia in MIRPE. Materials and Methods: We performed a single institution retrospective review of pediatric patients undergoing MIRPE from June 2017 to July 2018. Multimodal (MM) analgesia was used in all patients. In addition, most patients received either cryoanalgesia or elastomeric pain pumps (EPPs) as adjuncts to postoperative analgesia. Primary outcome was clinically significant late pneumothorax. Secondary outcomes included length of stay, pain scores, opiate use, and bar displacement requiring reoperation. Results: A total of 101 patients undergoing MIRPE were included: 45 had cryoanalgesia + MM, 45 EPP + MM, and 11 MM alone. Postoperative tube thoracostomy was placed in 5 patients with cryoanalgesia (4 pneumothorax; 1 effusion), 1 patient with EPP (1 pneumothorax), and none in MM alone (P = .25). Pain scores at discharge were similar in all groups. Cryoanalgesia patients received less overall inpatient opioids than other groups (P < .05). No patient required reoperation for bar displacement. Conclusion: Cryoanalgesia is an effective therapy for pain control in MIRPE. Because thermal injury can occur on the lung and chest wall with cryoanalgesia, we implemented techniques to limit and prevent this injury. Cryoanalgesia offers a safe alternative for postoperative analgesia with significant reduction in inpatient opioid requirement.

The goal of the study is to determine the superiority of cryoanalgesia compared to standard of care for return to normal quality of life. A randomized, active controlled, parallel groups trial (category IIb medical device) was designed for patients undergoing pectus excavatum repair. Participants were screened from the elective surgical lists at Istituto Gaslini, Genova, Italy, and they all were part of the academic practice setting. Once enrolled, patients were randomly assigned to one of the two study arms: cryoanalgesia vs. standard of care (epidural-based analgesia). The primary outcome was the Pediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) and the subcomponents (psychosocial and physical health) 14 days after surgery. Protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee (278/2021-DB id 11 421) and conducted between February 2022 and October 2023. Eighty-eight patients were enrolled in the study: forty-five to cryoanalgesia and forty-three in the epidural arm. The PedsQL median (IQR) at the 14th day was 59.8 (48.4, 71.2) vs. 67.9 (58.7, 73.9) (95% CI: 0.46-13; difference 6.5; p = 0.07) with ITT analysis, and 59.8 (48.37, 71.20) vs. 69.02 (58.70, 73.91) (95% CI: 0.82, 14; difference 7.4; p = 0.028) with PP analysis, in the cryoanalgesia and in the standard of care group, respectively. Irrespective of treatment, a significant decrease in both the PedsQL total score and its subcomponents was found. This effect persisted when stratified by treatment: physical health showed a decrease in both arms, while psychosocial health demonstrated a more marked decrease in the standard of care arm (q-value = 0.028), but not in the cryoanalgesia arm (q-value = 0.056). Cryoanalgesia did not improve return to baseline quality of life 2 weeks after surgery. However, it showed to be beneficial in the psychosocial component of the PedsQL scale.

However, opioid avoidance, cost reduction, and length of stay (LOS) still offer room for improvement. The focus of this study is to identify the impact of Bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension (Exparel) on outcomes. Methods: A retrospective review at a Pediatric specialty hospital from October 1, 2014 to December 31, 2019 was performed. All patients underwent a Nuss procedure (n = 19) for pectus excavatum.

Surgical repair can be complicated by post-operative analgesic challenges. Thoracic epidural analgesia, patient-controlled analgesia, and multimodal pain control are among the most common strategies. We sought to define the current utilization of intraoperative thoracic neurolysis, hypothesizing that this would minimize length of stay (LOS) and post-operative narcotic use with relatively higher proportion of non-narcotic post-operative analgesia. We performed a retrospective review of the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database between 2017 and 2020. We first identified patients who underwent a pectus repair via ICD-10-PCS codes. We used ICD-10-PCS codes 01580ZZ and 01584ZZ to identify those patients who underwent concomitant thoracic neurolysis. Statistical analyses were performed using R; p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. We identified 2979 patients who underwent a pectus repair. 184 underwent a concomitant thoracic nerve destruction procedure (6.7%); 13 were performed in 2017 (2.01%), 76 in 2018 (10.7%), and 84 in 2019 (9.6%). LOS was shorter in those patients who underwent neurolysis (mean=2.55 vs 3.73 days, SD=1.33 vs 1.78 days, p<0.001). There were fewer post-operative ICU admissions in neurolysis patients (3/184 vs. 193/2795, p = 0.003). The cost of procedures that included a neurolysis were higher, though not significantly so (mean=$24,885.64 vs $22,200.59). Thoracic neurolysis may be a useful analgesic strategy, expediating post-operative discharge and potentially obviating the need for intensive care. Further larger-scale prospective trials should be considered to further elucidate the role of this analgesia method. Level III. Copyright © 2022.

A retrospective analysis was performed from a single, quaternary referral centre, prospective database on patients receiving thoracotomies between January 2020 and March 2022. Patients undergoing transthoracic hiatal hernia repair, lung resection or double-lung transplant were divided between epidural and cryoablation cohorts. Primary outcomes were length of stay, intraoperative procedure time, crossover pain management and oral narcotic usage the day before discharge. During the study period, 186 patients underwent a transthoracic hiatal hernia repair, lung resection or double-lung transplant with 94 receiving a preoperative epidural and 92 undergoing cryoablation. Subgroup analysis demonstrated no significant differences in demographics, operative length, length of stay or perioperative narcotic use. Notably, over a third of patients in each cryoablation subgroup received a postoperative epidural (45.5% transthoracic hiatal hernia repair, 38.5% lung resection and 45.0% double-lung transplant) for further pain management during their admission.

This document aims to guide clinicians in the selection of patients suitable for LT approaches and preoperative optimization. Details of operative techniques are described, with an overview of hemisternotomy and bilateral thoracotomy approaches. A review of the best surgical practices for placement of the pump, inflow cannula, and outflow graft provides advice on the best surgical strategies to avoid device malpositioning while optimizing VAD function. Experts' opinions on cardiopulmonary bypass, postoperative management, and approaches for pump exchange and explant are presented. This review also emphasizes the critical need for multidisciplinary teams and specific training. This expert consensus review provides a compact guide to LT for VAD implantation, from patient selection through intraoperative tips and postoperative management.

Achieving optimal pain control is a priority for adolescents undergoing surgical correction of this condition. Options for pain control include the use of subcutaneous catheters (On-Q® pumps) and epidurals. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of using subcutaneous catheters for pain control and to compare them with the use of epidurals during surgical correction of pectus excavatum. We identified patients who underwent pectus excavatum repair at our institution between January 2010 and August 2016. Patients were divided into two cohorts (epidural or On-Q pump). Patient charts were reviewed for length of stay, pain scores, pain medications, and complications. A total of 124 patients were included. Forty percent of patients used an epidural (n = 50), and 60% had the On-Q pump (n = 74). The average patient age was 15.6 years. The average Haller index was 4.3. The On-Q pump population had a significant decrease in postoperative length of stay (mean [M] = 4.86, standard deviation [SD] = 0.85) compared with the epidural population (M = 5.60, SD = 0.97); P ≤ .001. There was a significant difference observed in pain scores for patients on the epidural (M = 2.91, SD = 1.13) and On-Q pump (M = 3.81, SD = 1.19; P ≤ .001). There was n = 1 wound infection in each group. The use of bilateral subcutaneous infusion catheters is a safe and effective method for pain control in patients undergoing surgical correction of pectus excavatum. Even though the degree of pain control is not necessarily superior to epidurals, in this study, the catheters were associated with a shorter postoperative length of stay in this patient population and did not increase the incidence of complications.", "mesh": ["Adolescent", "Analgesia, Epidural", "Analgesics", "Catheters", "Female", "Funnel Chest", "Humans", "Infusion Pumps", "Infusions, Subcutaneous", "Length of Stay", "Male", "Pain Management", "Pain Measurement", "Pain, Postoperative", "Retrospective Studies"]}

About 4500 LTxs are performed annually worldwide. It is considered challenging and complex surgery regarding anaesthesia and pain management. While providing adequate analgesia is crucial for patient comfort, early mobilisation and prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications, standardising an analgesic protocol is challenging due to the diversity of aetiologies, surgical approaches and the potential use of extracorporeal life support (ECLS). Although thoracic epidural analgesia is commonly considered the gold standard, concerns regarding procedural safety and its potential for devastating consequences have led physicians to seek safer analgesic modalities such as thoracic nerve blocks. The advantages of thoracic nerve blocks for general thoracic surgery are well established. However, their utility in LTx remains unclear. Considering paucity of relevant literature, this review aims to raise awareness about the literature gap in the field and highlight the need for further high-quality studies determining the effectiveness of available techniques.

Several procedures have been described to manage this deformity, including cartilage resection with sternal osteotomy (the Ravitch procedure) and a minimally invasive repair technique (the Nuss procedure). While initially described as a nonthoracoscopic technique, the current surgical approach of the Royal Childrens Hospital involves thoracoscopic assistance. Postoperative pain is significant in patients undergoing the pectus repair and multiple analgesic regimens have been advocated with continuous thoracic epidural infusions and opioid infusions the most common. Some authors have advocated patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), paravertebral nerve blocks (PVNB), and wound infusion catheters as alternatives. The primary aim of this study was to assess our experience with postoperative pain and analgesia requirements associated with the minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum in children. This is a retrospective cohort study with a contemporaneous comparison group examining patients treated between January 2005 and December 2015 for minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum by the Nuss procedure. Two hundred and seventeen patients [mean age 14.9 (sd 1.9) years] with pectus excavatum treated at the Royal Childrens Hospital between 2005 and 2015 were identified. All patients were managed with thoracic epidural analgesia and intravenous morphine infusions. The epidural was effective in the postanesthesia care unit in 97.3% (failure to place an epidural rate was 4 (1.9%); no block on awakening 0.9%). A further 4 (1.8%) were removed within 24 h. The mean morphine equivalent dose in the first 24 h was 0.8 mg·kg-1 ·day-1 . PCA was continued for a mean of 3.8 days and the total mean morphine equivalent dose was 2.2 mg·kg-1 ·day-1 . Minor complications occurred in 67 (30.9%) with postoperative nausea and vomiting in 36 patients (16.6%) and urinary retention requiring an indwelling catheter in 40 patients (18.4%). An epidural-based analgesic regime is associated with low pain scores and few acute complications. The continuation of morphine analgesia after the first postoperative day is common but associated with an increased incidence of urinary retention and nausea and vomiting. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.", "mesh": ["Adolescent", "Analgesia", "Analgesia, Patient-Controlled", "Anesthesia", "Cohort Studies", "Drug Administration Routes", "Female", "Funnel Chest", "Humans", "Male", "Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures", "Nerve Block", "Pain, Postoperative", "Retrospective Studies"]}

After obtaining permission/assent (Institutional Review Board no. 06 08 128), patients were randomized to either epidural or patient-controlled analgesia with fixed protocols for each arm. The primary outcome variable was length of stay with a power of .8 and α of .05. One hundred ten patients were enrolled. There was no difference in length of stay between the 2 arms.

We report results with single-incision video-assisted thoracic major pulmonary resections during our first 2 years of experience. In June 2010, we began performing video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomies through a uniportal approach (no rib spreading). By July 12, 2012, 102 patients had undergone this single-incision approach. Of 102 attempted major resections, 97 were successfully completed with a single incision (operations in 3 patients were converted to open surgery and 2 patients needed 1 additional incision). Five uniportal pneumonectomies were not included in the study. We have analyzed early outcomes of successful uniportal lobectomies (92 patients studied). Right upper lobectomy was the most frequent resection (28 cases). Mean surgical time was 154.1 ± 46 minutes (range, 60-310 minutes), mean number of lymph nodes was 14.5 ± 7 (range, 5-38 nodes), and mean number of explored nodal stations was 4.6 ± 1.2 (range, 3-8 stations). The mean tumor size was 2.8 ± 1.5 cm (0-6.5 cm). The median duration of time a chest tube was in place was 2 days and the median length of hospital stay was 3 days. There were complications in 14 patients; no postoperative 30-day mortality was reported.

Cryoanalgesia is considered a safe procedure with minimal risk of complications when performed with percutaneous approaches under imaging guidance. In the era of an opioid overdose crisis, cryoanalgesia can be proposed as an alternative aiming at controlling pain and improving life quality. Imaging guidance has substituted open surgical and nerve stimulation approaches in nerve identification, significantly contributing to the minimally invasive character of percutaneous approaches. Ultrasound or computed tomography can serve as low cost, ideal guiding techniques due to their abilities for precise anatomic delineation, high spatial resolution and good tissue contrast.

Despite its ubiquity, postoperative pain control has been poorly studied in this patient population. Moreover, poor pain management has been associated with adverse surgical outcomes. Multimodal analgesic injections have been well studied in the adult population, demonstrating safety and efficacy in reducing postoperative pain and narcotic consumption, but this modality has not been studied in pediatric patients undergoing similarly complex procedures. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a multimodal surgical site injection for postoperative pain control following operative management of hip dysplasia in patients with CP. After obtaining IRB approval, a multicenter, randomized double-blind placebo control trial was completed. Patients below 18 years old with a diagnosis of CP who were scheduled for varus derotation osteotomy (VDRO) of the proximal femur were randomized to receive a surgical-site injection with either a combination of ropivacaine (3 mg/kg), epinephrine (0.5 mg), and ketorolac (0.5 mg/kg) (experimental group) or normal saline (control). All included patients had identical postoperative care, including immobilization, physical therapy, and standardized, multimodal postoperative pain control. Pain scores and narcotic consumption were recorded at regular intervals and compared between groups utilizing two-tailed t test or a nonparametric Mann-Whitney test for quantitative variables and a Fischer exact test for categorical variables. Thirty-four patients were included, evenly divided between study arms. There were no significant differences in demographic variables, gross motor function classification system (GMFCS), comorbidities, preoperative radiographic parameters, or concomitant surgeries between groups. Patients in the experimental group required significantly lower narcotic medications at all postoperative time points from PACU until hospital discharge compared with controls (0.41 ± 0.42 vs. 1.87 ± 2.05 total morphine mEQ/kg, P =0.01). Similarly, patients in the experimental group were found to have significantly lower pain scores throughout their hospital stays compared with controls (1.0 ± 0.6 vs. 2.4 ± 1.1 mean pain score, P <0.001). There were no significant differences in operative time, OR time, blood transfusion requirements or hospital length of stay between groups. There were no adverse medication reactions or injection site complications in either group. In patients with CP undergoing hip reconstruction, surgical-site injection with a multimodal analgesic combination improves pain control and reduces narcotic consumption in the early postoperative period with no observed adverse effects. Local multimodal analgesic injections should be adopted as part of standard multimodal pain control in this patient population for all osseous surgeries. Level I-therapeutic.

Within a certain cold temperature range, peripheral nerve function is interrupted and recovers, without neuroma formation. Cryoanalgesia has most often been applied to the intercostal nerve. Cryoanalgesia has applications to peripheral nerve surgery, yet is poorly understood by reconstructive microsurgeons. Histopathology of nerve injury was reviewed to understand cold applied to peripheral nerve. Literature review was performed utilizing the PubMed and MEDLINE databases to identify comparative studies of the efficacy of intraoperative cryoanalgesia versus thoracic epidural anesthesia following thoracotomy. Data were analyzed using Fisher's exact and analysis of variance tests. A similar approach was used for pudendal cryoanalgesia. Application of inclusion and exclusion criteria resulted in 16 comparative clinical studies of intercostal nerve for this review. For thoracotomy, nine studies compared cryoanalgesia with pharmaceutical analgesia, with seven demonstrating significant reduction in postoperative opioid use or postoperative acute pain scores. In these nine studies, there was no association between the number of nerves treated and the reduction in acute postoperative pain. One study compared cryoanalgesia with local anesthetic and demonstrated a significant reduction in acute pain with cryoanalgesia. Three studies compared cryoanalgesia with epidural analgesia and demonstrated no significant difference in postoperative pain or postoperative opioid use. Interventional radiology targets pudendal nerves using computed tomography imaging with positive outcomes for the patient with pain of pudendal nerve origin. Cryoanalgesia is a term used for the treatment of peripheral nerve problems that would benefit from a proverbial reset of peripheral nerve function. It does not ablate the nerve. Intraoperative cryoanalgesia to intercostal nerves is a safe and effective means of postoperative analgesia following thoracotomy. For pudendal nerve injury, where an intrapelvic surgical approach may be difficult, cryoanalgesia may provide sufficient clinical relief, thereby preserving pudendal nerve function. Thieme.

We aimed to understand the impact that cryoanalgesia had on opioid utilization and outcomes of pediatric patients undergoing minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE). A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted of all patients (< 18 y) who underwent MIRPE (2011-2019). Patients receiving cryoanalgesia were compared to those who did not. The primary outcome was total postoperative, inpatient, opioid use, measured as milligrams of oral morphine equivalents per kilogram (OME/kg). Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed. Of 35 patients, 20 received cryoanalgesia (57%). Baseline characteristics were similar. Patients who received cryoanalgesia had a lower opioid requirement: median 2.3 mg OME/kg (IQR 1.2-3.1), versus 4.9 mg OME/kg (IQR 2.9-5.8), P < 0.001. Accounting for receipt of cryoanalgesia, epidural, and/or patient-controlled analgesia, cryoanalgesia was associated with a 3.3 mg OME/kg reduction in opioid use (P < 0.001). Median length of stay (LOS) was shorter in cryoanalgesia patients: 3.1 d (IQR 2.3-3.4), versus 5.1 d (IQR 4.3-5.4), P < 0.001. Complications within 90 d were similar between groups. Cryoanalgesia is an effective adjunctive pain control modality for patients undergoing MIRPE. Use of cryoanalgesia was associated with lower postoperative opioid requirements and shorter LOS, without increased short-term complications, and should be considered for enhanced recovery after MIRPE.

METHODS: We conducted a parallel-group multicenter randomized trial that recruited participants with known or suspected early-stage lung cancer and randomly assigned them to open or VATS resection of their lesions. The primary outcome was physical function at 5 weeks as a measure of recovery using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer core health-related quality of life questionnaire (QLQ-C30) (scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better function; the clinical minimally important difference for improvement is 5 points). We followed the patients for an additional 47 weeks for other outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 503 participants were randomly assigned (247 to VATS and 256 to open lobectomy). At 5 weeks, median physical function was 73 in the VATS group and 67 in the open surgery group, with a mean difference of 4.65 points (95% confidence interval, 1.69 to 7.61). Of the participants allocated to VATS, 30.7% had serious adverse events after discharge compared with 37.8% of those allocated to open surgery (risk ratio, 0.81 [95% confidence interval, 0.66 to 1.00]). At 52 weeks, there were no differences in cancer progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.74 [0.43 to 1.27]) or overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.67 [0.32 to 1.40]). CONCLUSIONS: VATS lobectomy for lung cancer is associated with a better recovery of physical function in the 5 weeks after random assignment compared with open surgery. Long-term oncologic outcomes will require continued follow-up to assess.

The anomaly is typically repaired using open techniques, employing orthopedic fixation devices. Here, we report the results of a minimally invasive hybrid procedure to repair pectus arcuatum. The procedure combines a standard Nuss procedure to correct the depressed sternum with a short upper chest (in boys) or inter-mammary (in girls) incision for bilateral subperichondrial resection of the upper costal cartilages, osteotomy, and correction of the manubrial angulation. The medical records of all patients who underwent the procedure over the last 10 years were reviewed. Five patients, 3 boys and 2 girls, aged 14 to 17 years, underwent the procedure. Three patients had their pectus bars removed 3-4 years after repair. Follow-up after correction ranged from 6 months to 7 years. Good correction resulted in all patients achieving recovery without complications and recurrence. To date, all patients have been satisfied with their results. The minimally invasive hybrid procedure adequately corrects pectus arcuatum with minimal scarring and high satisfaction.

A single institution, prospective study of 121 patients undergoing Nuss bar placement with CRYO for pectus excavatum was conducted to assess sensory recovery. Patients received CRYO from T3-T8 and were followed at scheduled intervals. The primary outcome was time to return of normal chest wall sensation. Secondary outcomes included alterations in sensation, permanent numbness, and chronic neuropathic pain. Following CRYO, median time to normal sensation was 6.0 (range 1-12) months. This was achieved postoperatively by 14.9% at 3 months, 62.3% at 6 months, 85.1% at 9 months, and 98.3% at 12 months. 1.7% had a small area of persistent/permanent numbness in the lower central sternum. The most common altered sensation was hypersensitivity which occurred in 20.7%. Hypersensitivity began on average at 3.0 months postoperatively (range 0.25-6 months) and lasted a median of 1.0 (range 0.5-9) months. Only 5.8% described their altered sensation as painful, and all of these were successfully treated with gabapentin and/or capsaicin cream. All others resolved spontaneously. There were no cases of chronic neuropathic pain. Sensory recovery following CRYO is a slow process that ultimately leads to normal sensation in virtually all patients by one year. Hypersensitivity is more common than expected but is rarely described as painful and always resolves. Permanent numbness can occur but is very rare and limited in scope. Therapeutic.

Association of the group with length of stay (LOS), in hospital opioid use (intravenous morphine equivalents (MEq)/kg over postoperative day (POD) 0-2), and oral opioid use beyond POD7 was analyzed using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) with propensity scores, followed by multivariable regression. Groups had similar demographics. Compared to EPI, ESP had longer block time and higher rate of ketamine and dexmedetomidine use. LOS for ESP was 2 days IQR (2, 2) compared to 3 days IQR (3, 4) for EPI (p < 0.01). Compared to EPI, ESP group had higher opioid use (in MEq/kg) intraoperatively (0.32 (IQR 0.27, 0.36) vs. 0.28 (0.24, 0.32); p < 0.01) but lower opioid use on POD 0 (0.09 (IQR 0.04, 0.17) vs. 0.11 (0.08, 0.17); p = 0.03) and POD2 (0.00 (IQR 0.00, 0.00) vs. 0.04 (0.00, 0.06) ; p < 0.01).

However, their independent relationship is not described. We investigated how regional anesthesia and surgical volume are associated with length of stay (LOS), postoperative opioid use, operating room utilization, and complications. This is a 9-center retrospective review of patients ≤21 ys after Nuss procedure for pectus excavatum (2016-2020). High-volume centers and surgeons defined as the upper-quartile for annual procedures. Outcomes were compared with mixed effects linear/logistic regression models with random intercepts by institution as appropriate. A single-center unadjusted analysis was performed of erector spinae catheter (ESC) utilization (due to nonuniform use; high-volume only at 1-center). 780 patients were included. Significant variation existed in anesthetic approach and volume. Cryoablation was independently associated with shorter LOS (-2.1 d; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.6,-1.7) and lower postoperative opioid utilization (-120 morphine milligram equivalents, 95% CI: -181, -58.1) but increased surgical time (+45 min; 95% CI: 30.3, 59.8). Individual surgeon volume was associated with decreased LOS (-0.3 d; 95% CI: -0.5, -0.01), though high-volume centers had increased complications (odds ratio 2.2; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.2). There was no association between anesthetic approach and surgical complications. Within the single center utilizing ESCs (n = 138), a shorter LOS (2 versus 3 d, P < 0.01) was observed compared to those not receiving an ESC (n = 19). Analgesic approaches varied significantly across institutions and limited our ability to directly compare cryoablation and ESCs. On multivariate analysis, cryoablation was associated with decreased LOS and postoperative opioid use, irrespective of center and surgeon volume. ESCs were similarly associated with improved outcomes. Rigorous prospective comparison of ESCs and cryoablation is warranted.

Despite its minimally invasive technical approach, postoperative pain is a significant morbidity that often results in increased length of stay. Multi-modal pain control strategies have been used in the past with limited success. Recently, the use of intraoperative intercostal nerve cryoablation (CA) has been added. In the present study, we aim to evaluate the effects of CA on postoperative pain control, opioid requirements, and perioperative outcomes. A single-center, retrospective chart review of all patients (less than 18 years old) who underwent MIRPE from 2009 to 2020 was performed. CA was started in June 2018. Data collection included demographics, preoperative characteristics, intraoperative findings, and postoperative outcomes. We hypothesized that CA would be associated with improved pain scores, lower doses of total inpatient opioid requirement, and shorter length of stay (LOS). One hundred sixty-one patients met inclusion criteria: 75 underwent intraoperative CA and 86 underwent MIRPE without CA (NCA group). CA significantly decreased median LOS from 4 days in NCA to 2 days; the use of CA was the only significant predictor of LOS on linear regression. CA was also associated with decreased total PCA, intravenous opioid, and oral opioid dosages. There was no difference in inpatient pain scores and a slight increase in mean procedure time. However, CA was associated with significantly decreased postoperative complications. The use of cryoablation during MIRPE significantly decreases LOS, perioperative opioid requirements, and postoperative complications, with a minimal increase in operative time.

To summarize the current status of minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum, we reviewed and appraised our 10-year experience with a novel approach, a morphology-tailored technique, including diverse bar shaping, bar fixation, and techniques for adults. We analyzed the data of 1170 consecutive patients with pectus excavatum who underwent minimally invasive repair between August 1999 and September 2008. All pectus repairs were performed by the primary author (H.J.P.) with our modified technique. The mean age was 10.3 years (range, 16 months to 51 years). There were 331 adult patients (>15 years) (28.3%). A total of 576 patients (49.2%) had bar removal after a mean of 2.5 years (range, 10 days to 7 years). The asymmetry index change (1.10-1.02, P < .001) demonstrated post-repair symmetry. Complication rates decreased through the 3 time periods (1999-2002 [n = 335]; 2003-2005 [n = 441]; 2006-2008 [n = 394]) as follows: pneumothorax rate (7.5% vs 4.3% vs 0.8%; P < .001) and bar displacement rate (3.8% vs 2.3% vs 0.5%; P = .002). Reoperation rate also decreased (4.8% vs 2.5% vs 0.8%; P = .002). Satisfaction outcomes were excellent in 92.7%, good in 5.9%, and fair in 1.4% of patients. After bar removal, 3 patients (0.6%) had minor recurrences. Minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum based on a novel morphology-tailored, patient-specific approach is effective for quality repair of the full spectrum of pectus excavatum, including asymmetry and adult patients.

The purpose of this study was to describe adolescents' pain experiences after thoracoscopic pectus excavatum repair (Nuss procedure) using the Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool. This prospective descriptive longitudinal study was designed to test the hypothesis that pain quality descriptors reported are consistent with neuropathic pain. A convenience sample of 23 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years from a single urban, university affiliated, nonprofit children's hospital consented to self-report pain using the Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool before and during hospitalization, and up to 14 months after Nuss procedure. Visual analytic techniques were used to analyze reported pain intensity, location, and affective, evaluative, sensory, and temporal qualities. Postoperative pain quality, intensity, number of sites, and surface area decreased over time. Word clouds illustrated that neuropathic sensory and temporal pain quality descriptors increased in frequency 2 to 6 weeks after surgery and were the predominant descriptors 2 to 4 months after surgery. Dot matrix charts illustrated an inconsistent relationship of pain quality and intensity with pain surface area. Pain quality should be assessed with valid, reliable, and developmentally appropriate tools. Visual analytics help illustrate pain quality at single points in time and longitudinally and may be helpful in guiding postoperative pain treatment.

Although surgical repair has been performed for more than 50 years, there are no prospective multicenter studies of its management. This observational study followed pectus excavatum patients treated surgically at 11 centers in North America, according to the method of choice of the patient and surgeon. Before operation, all underwent evaluation with CT scan, pulmonary function tests, and body image survey. Data were collected about associated conditions, hospital complications, and perioperative pain. One year after completion of treatment, patients will repeat the preoperative evaluations. This article addresses early results only. Of 416 patients screened, 327 were enrolled; 284 underwent the Nuss procedure and 43 had the open procedure. Median preoperative CT index was 4.4. Pulmonary function testing before operation showed mean forced vital capacity of 90% of predicted values; forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)), 89% of predicted; and forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the forced vital capacity (FEF(25% to 75%)), 85% of predicted. Early postcorrection results showed that operations were performed without mortality and with minimal morbidity at 30 days postoperatively. Median hospital stay was 4 days. Postoperative pain was a median of 3 on a scale of 10 at time of discharge; the worst pain experienced was the same as was expected by the patients (median 8), and by 30 days after correction or operation, the median pain score was 1.

After revising our epidural transition and modifying the PCA protocol, we conducted a multi-institutional prospective randomized trial to evaluate these two pain control strategies. Patients were randomized to epidural or PCA following minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum with standard protocols for each arm. Primary outcome was length of stay with secondary variables including mean patient pain scores, complications, and parental satisfaction. Scores were pooled for the two groups and reported as means with standard deviation. Results were compared using t-tests and one-way analysis of variance with p-value < 0.05 determining significance. Sixty-five patients were enrolled, 32 epidural and 33 PCA. Enrollment was stopped early when we developed an alternative strategy for controlling these patients' pain. There was no difference in length of stay in hours between the two arms; epidural 111.3 ± 18.5 versus PCA 111.4 ± 51.4, p = 0.98. Longer operative time was found in the epidural group. Nine patients in the epidural group (28%) required a PCA in addition to epidural for adequate pain control. Mean pain scores were lower on postoperative day 0 in the epidural group compared with the PCA groups, but were otherwise similar.

Ideal methods should have a high success rate, with easy implementation and minimal complications. Debate exists over the optimal pain control method. This randomized trial was designed to compare epidural (EPI) and intercostal nerve catheter with patient-controlled analgesia (ICN-PCA) for pain control after thoracotomy. The study included 124 randomized patients; 91 had sufficient data for analysis (44 EPI, 47 ICN-PCA). The primary endpoint was pain measurement using a composite of a visual analogue scale, numerical rating, and categorical rating. A second endpoint was the success rate of each method. Pulmonary function tests, antibiotics, intensive care unit (ICU), and hospital days, and use of nonprotocol pain medications were also compared. There were 12 pain observations per patient (90% completed on days 1 to 5). The pain composite revealed an average postoperative pain score of 2.4 on a scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain). There was no difference between the groups. Failures of the planned method of analgesia included 9 in the EPI group and 4 in the ICN group (p = 0.23). Another 20 patients were excluded (no difference between groups) due to unsuspected mediastinal metastases precluding thoracotomy (n = 13), and other miscellaneous factors precluding follow-up (n = 7).

The prevalence ranges from 6.28 to 12 cases per 1000 around the world. Generally pectus excavatum is present at birth or is identified after a few weeks or months; however, sometimes it becomes evident only at puberty. The consequence of the condition on a individual's life is variable, some live a normal life and others have physical and psychological symptoms such as: precordial pain after exercises; impairments of pulmonary and cardiac function; shyness and social isolation. For many years, sub-perichondrial resection of the costal cartilages, with or without transverse cuneiform osteotomy of the sternum and placement of a substernal support, called conventional surgery, was the most accepted option for surgical repair of these patients. From 1997 a new surgical repair called, minimally invasive surgery, became available. This less invasive surgical option consists of the retrosternal placement of a curved metal bar, without resections of the costal cartilages or sternum osteotomy, and is performed by videothoracoscopy. However, many aspects that relate to the benefits and harms of both techniques have not been defined. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the conventional surgery compared with minimally invasive surgery for treating people with pectus excavatum. With the aim of increasing the sensitivity of the search strategy we used only terms related to the individual's condition (pectus excavatum); terms related to the interventions, outcomes and types of studies were not included. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, LILACS, and ICTPR. Additionally we searched yet reference lists of articles and conference proceedings. All searches were done without language restriction.Date of the most recent searches: 14 January 2014. We considered randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials that compared traditional surgery with minimally invasive surgery for treating pectus excavatum. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of the trials identified and agreed trial eligibility after a consensus meeting. The authors also assessed the risk of bias of the eligible trials. Initially we located 4111 trials from the electronic searches and two further trials from other resources. All trials were added into reference management software and the duplicates were excluded, leaving 2517 studies. The titles and abstracts of these 2517 studies were independently analyzed by two authors and finally eight trials were selected for full text analysis, after which they were all excluded, as they did not fulfil the inclusion criteria.

We evaluated the efficacy of intercostal cryoneurolysis as an analgesic adjunct for chest wall pain, specifically addressing the applicability of intercostal cryoneurolysis for pain control after chest wall trauma. A systematic review was performed through searches of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. We included studies involving patients of all ages that evaluated the efficacy of intercostal cryoneurolysis as a pain adjunct for chest wall pathology. Quantitative and qualitative synthesis was performed. Twenty-three studies including 570 patients undergoing cryoneurolysis met eligibility criteria for quantitative analysis. Five subgroups of patients treated with intercostal cryoneurolysis were identified: pectus excavatum (nine studies); thoracotomy (eight studies); post-thoracotomy pain syndrome (three studies); malignant chest wall pain (two studies); and traumatic rib fractures (one study). There is overall low-quality evidence supporting intercostal cryoneurolysis as an analgesic adjunct for chest wall pain. A majority of studies demonstrated decreased inpatient narcotic use with intercostal cryoneurolysis compared with conventional pain modalities. Intercostal cryoneurolysis may also lead to decreased hospital length of stay. The procedure did not definitively increase operative time, and risk of complications was low. Given the favorable risk-to-benefit profile, both percutaneous and thoracoscopic intercostal cryoneurolysis may serve as a worthwhile analgesic adjunct in trauma patients with rib fractures who have failed conventional medical management.

The paper aims at presenting the authors' own 6 years of experience in funnel chest repair with MIRPE technique. Also, many technical problems of this method are discussed. Between 1999 and 2005, 461 patients (99 female and 362 male, aged 3-31 years, mean age 15.2 years) with pectus excavatum were operated with the Nuss technique. All patients were operated-on according to the original operative protocol proposed by Donald Nuss. With growing experience, own modifications were introduced. Insertion of two bars was done in 17.4%, transverse sternotomy in adolescents with rigid anterior chest wall in 7.8%, limited excision of the rib cartilages in 5.9%, and parasternal fixation of the bar to prevent it from rotating in 59.7% of patients. There were no deaths. Intraoperative complications were noted in 19 (4.1%) patients and postoperative ones were observed in 43 (9.3%) patients. The operative time ranged from 25 to 130 min (52 min on average). In 192 (41.6%) patients, an epidural block was used. The hospital stay ranged from 4 to 12 days with the mean of 5.3 days. A redo procedure for the bar rotation was necessary in 13 (2.8%) patients. The support bar has been removed in 260 (56.4%) patients so far. In all the patients, an adequate contour of the anterior chest wall has been maintained. MIRPE proposed by Nuss has all the features of a minimally invasive procedure and is straightforward. Better clinical results are achievable in patients under 12 years of age with a symmetric deformity. In older patients (over 15 years of age) with a rigid chest or with an asymmetric deformity, additional procedures are required to achieve a comprehensive correction of the deformity. Recent results and forward clinical observations may give proof to establish MIRPE as a method of choice in funnel chest correction.", "mesh": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Age Distribution", "Age Factors", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Funnel Chest", "Humans", "Male", "Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures", "Postoperative Complications", "Prostheses and Implants", "Severity of Illness Index", "Treatment Outcome"]}

Cryoanalgesia has the potentiality to reduce analgesic consumption and length of hospitalization. However, cryoanalgesia has not been standardized yet: the previous reports describe different techniques and systems and include only small series. In Europe, no reports on cryoanalgesia for pectus repair have been published so far. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective single center pilot study performed in adolescents undergoing minimally invasive pectus excavatum repair with a new cryoanalgesia system, using a probe designed specifically for thoracoscopy. This new double lumen probe has the theoretical advantage of freezing only in its tip, so reducing the risk of complications. Results: Seven patients undergoing pectus excavatum repair were treated with cryoanalgesia performed with the new probe. No complications of cryoanalgesia were reported. Total consumption of morphine during hospital stay was between 0.1 and 0.35 mg/kg, with no side effects reported. Mean time to discharge was 2.4 days. All patients reported a good pain control with a fair need of rescue medications for pain relief during the first week after discharge, and a very good pain control without need of rescue medications during following weeks. Conclusions: Our pilot study showed that the new cryoanalgesia device is efficacious in terms of pain control, hospital stay and resumption of post-operative activities. The cryoprobe designed allowed an easy and safe maneuver. A prospective trial is needed to better define the risks and benefits of this technique.

A number of the trials, however, reported the study using the median, the minimum and maximum values, and/or the first and third quartiles. Hence, in order to combine results, one may have to estimate the sample mean and standard deviation for such trials. In this paper, we propose to improve the existing literature in several directions. First, we show that the sample standard deviation estimation in Hozo et al.'s method (BMC Med Res Methodol 5:13, 2005) has some serious limitations and is always less satisfactory in practice. Inspired by this, we propose a new estimation method by incorporating the sample size. Second, we systematically study the sample mean and standard deviation estimation problem under several other interesting settings where the interquartile range is also available for the trials. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies for the three frequently encountered scenarios, respectively. For the first two scenarios, our method greatly improves existing methods and provides a nearly unbiased estimate of the true sample standard deviation for normal data and a slightly biased estimate for skewed data. For the third scenario, our method still performs very well for both normal data and skewed data. Furthermore, we compare the estimators of the sample mean and standard deviation under all three scenarios and present some suggestions on which scenario is preferred in real-world applications. In this paper, we discuss different approximation methods in the estimation of the sample mean and standard deviation and propose some new estimation methods to improve the existing literature.

We analyzed the results of various bar fixation techniques in a patient cohort of 1,816 consecutive pectus excavatum repairs using a pectus bar between 1999 and 2012. Techniques that have been evolving were a stabilizer (STB, 1999); multipoint pericostal suture fixation (MPF, 2001); and the new devices: claw fixator (CFT, 2007) and hinge plate (HP, 2009). The claw fixator is used for sutureless bar fixation by hooking the rib with blades, whereas the hinge plate prevents intercostal muscle stripping at the hinge points. Patients were divided into groups according to the technique used, and the outcomes were compared. Early bar dislocation rates were as follows: STB 3.33% (6 of 180), MPF 0.56% (4 of 760), CFT 0.57% (4 of 699), and CFT+HP 0% (0 of 177; p = 0.002). Reoperation rates were as follows: STB 5% (9 of 180), MPF 1.57% (12 of 760), CFT 2.10% (11 of 699), and CFT+HP 3.38% (6 of 177; p = 0.042). Total complication rates were also lower in the CFT+HP group (14.1%, 25 of 177) than the STB group (22.7%, 41 of 180; p < 0.01). By using the next-generation approach with the claw fixator plus hinge plate rather than the conventional stabilizer, we were able to reduce the bar dislocation rate and complications. We recommend that the conventional stabilizer be replaced with the claw fixator and hinge plate. Copyright © 2015 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Intercostal nerve cryoablation (Cryo) controls pain and decreases opioid use in MIRPE. Herein, we describe our experience with cryoablation in CRE. A retrospective chart review was performed of all patients undergoing CRE between 2018 and 2022. Data on demographics, clinical characteristics, operative details, and hospital course were collected. A total of 98 patients underwent CRE: 68 CRE without cryo, 22 CRE + Cryo, and 8 combined MIRPE + CRE + Cryo. Ninety percent of patients underwent bioabsorbable rib plating. Patients were predominantly female (79%, 73%, 50% respectively) with median ages 17.6, 16.9, and 14.2 years respectively. CRE + Cryo patients used significantly less opioids in hospital (0.6 OME/kg [0.1,1.2]) compared to CRE without cryo (1.0 OME/kg [0.6,2.1]), p < 0.05. The median length of stay (LOS) in CRE + Cryo was 1 day [1,2] compared to 2 days in CRE without cryo [1,2], p = 0.09. MIRPE + CRE + Cryo patients used 0.6 OME/kg [0.2,8.0] with a 2 day [1,5.5] LOS. Ninety-one percent of Cryo patients had cryoablation of T9 and/or T10 intercostal nerves, with no documented abdominal wall laxity at median follow-up of 16 days. Cryo was applied extra-thoracically in CRE + cryo without thoracoscopy or lung isolation, while MIRPE + CRE + Cryo used a combination extra-/intra-thoracic cryoablation in with thoracoscopy. Intercostal nerve cryoablation reduces opioid use and LOS in patients undergoing cartilaginous rib excision for slipping rib syndrome. Cryotherapy to as low as T10 did not result in abdominal wall laxity and can be applied extra-thoracically without the need for thoracoscopy. Ongoing prospective studies are required to assess the long-term outcomes. III. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Our analysis, using the NSQIP-P registry, aimed to assess if same-day discharge for the Nuss procedure influenced post-operative outcomes. The NSQIP-P database (2017-2022) identified patients who underwent the Nuss procedure. Patients discharged same-day postoperatively (SDD) were compared to those discharged 1-7 days postoperatively (non-SDD). Of 5486 patients identified, 91 (1.7%) were SDD.

The current study retrospectively reviews our experience over a 2.5 year period with thoracic epidural analgesia (TE), paravertebral blockade (PVB), and intravenous opioids delivered via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) to provide postoperative analgesia. The study cohort included 30 patients (mean age = 15.6 ± 1.5 years), 15 of whom were treated with PCA, 8 with TE, and 7 with PVB. There were no significant differences in pain scores between the 3 groups at any time point during the first 3 postoperative days. Compared to PCA, the PVB group had lower opioid consumption over the first 24 hours of hospitalization by 1.7 mg/kg morphine equivalents (95% CI of difference: 0.1, 3.3; p=0.035); but had higher opioid consumption by 2.0 mg/kg morphine equivalents than the TE group (95% CI of difference: 0.3, 3.7; p=0.024). There were no differences in opioid consumption between PVB and PCA or between PVB and TE at 48 or 72 hours. The number of intraoperative hypotension episodes was significantly lower in the PCA group when compared to the PVB group (p=0.001), with no difference between the PVB and TE groups. The use of regional anesthesia should be considered a viable option for the relief of postoperative pain in pediatric patients following the Nuss procedure albeit with a higher incidence of intraoperative hemodynamic effects. A randomized, prospective, study powered to compare all 3 techniques against one another would be necessary to confirm the significance of these findings.", "mesh": []}

Recently, cryoanalgesia has gained popularity owing to its superior pain control outcomes compared to those associated with conventional methods. However, because of its invasiveness, additional instrumentation requirement, and limited effect at early postoperative periods, we hypothesized that serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) could be an effective method for post-repair pain management and a possibly superior alternative. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients who had undergone MIRPE between March 2022 and August 2023. We compared the efficacy of pain control in three groups among 74 patients: Group N (conventional pain management, n = 24), Group C (cryoanalgesia, n = 24), and Group S (SAPB, n = 26). Group N received IV patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and a subcutaneous local anesthetic infusion. Group C received bilateral cryoanalgesia on the fourth and seventh intercostal nerves using a cryoprobe at -80°C for 2 min during the operation and IV-PCA postoperatively. Group S received continuous bilateral SAPB with 0.25% ropivacaine and IV-PCA. The pain levels were measured using the visual analog scale (VAS; resting and dynamic), and the total IV rescue analgesic consumption was determined. The three groups had similar baseline characteristics. Group S showed significantly less pain throughout the immediate postoperative course, resting VAS score at 3 h (Group N, 7.21 vs. Group C, 5.75 vs. Group S, 3.81; p < 0.001), and prominent less total IV rescue analgesic consumption (Group N, 116.16 mg vs. Group C, 52.75 mg vs. Group S, 16.61 mg; p < 0.001). SAPB resulted in better postoperative pain control than that associated with cryoanalgesia and conventional pain management after pectus excavatum repair, As it was effective in the immediate postoperative period, achieving a VAS score of <4 points (moderate pain) at 3 h postoperatively, it may play an important role and replace invasive cryoanalgesia in the management of pain after pectus surgery. © 2024 Rim, Park, Kang, Jeong, Koo, Jang and Bae.", "mesh": []}

This study investigated whether adding intraoperative methadone would reduce the postoperative opioid requirement during admission for patients undergoing MIRPE. A retrospective cohort chart review was conducted for 40 MIRPE patients between 2018 and 2020. Patients were stratified into 2 groups: those who received multimodal anesthesia (MM, n = 20) and those who received multimodal anesthesia with the addition of intraoperative methadone (MM + M, n = 20). Data collected included total opioid consumption during hospital stay (morphine milligram equivalents [MMEs]), hospital length of stay (LOS), pain scores, time to ambulation, and time to tolerating solid food. Addition of intraoperative methadone for patients undergoing MIRPE significantly reduced postoperative opioid requirements (MME/kg) during admission (P = .007). On average, patients in the MM group received 1.61 ± .55 MME/kg while patients in the MM + M group received 1.16 ± .44 MME/kg. Hospital opioid (non-methadone) total was also significantly reduced between the MM (1.87 ± .54) and MM + M group (1.37 ± .46), P = .003. There was no significant difference in hospital opioid total MME/kg administered between the groups. There were no significant differences observed in hospital LOS, pain scores, time to ambulation, or time to toleration of solid food. Incorporating intraoperative methadone for patients undergoing MIRPE reduced postoperative opioid requirements and hospital opioid (non-methadone) totals without a significant change in pain scores.

The gold standard of surgical correction is the minimally invasive Nuss procedure, which might cause severe pain and carries the risk of sensory disturbances and chronic discomfort. Integrating cryoanalgesia with standard multimodal analgesia improves the outcomes of this procedure. Based on histological results, it was hypothesised that the time of cryo-application can be reduced from the current standard period of two minutes. The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a one-minute application compared with the routine two-minute method in the same patient, considering the subjective perception of pain and sensory disturbances. A total of 33 patients were included in this prospective study. The results show that the assessment of pain severity and sensory disturbances did not differ significantly in terms of the time of cryo-application during first 14 days after the surgical procedure. The one-minute cryo-application time for intraoperative intercostal nerve cryoablation prior to the Nuss procedure seems to be as safe and effective as the routinely used two-minute application time in regards to pain severity, sensory disturbances, and the risk of chronic pain development.

The summary ICC for all paired VAS scores was 0.97 [95% CI = 0.96 to 0.98]. The Bland-Altman analysis showed that 50% of the paired measurements were within 2 mm of one another, 90% were within 9 mm, and 95% were within 16 mm. The paired measurements were more reproducible at the extremes of pain intensity than at moderate levels of pain. Reliability of the VAS for acute pain measurement as assessed by the ICC appears to be high. Ninety percent of the pain ratings were reproducible within 9 mm. These data suggest that the VAS is sufficiently reliable to be used to assess acute pain.", "mesh": ["Acute Disease", "Adult", "Aged", "Cohort Studies", "Confidence Intervals", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pain", "Pain Measurement", "Prospective Studies", "Reproducibility of Results", "Sampling Studies", "Sensitivity and Specificity", "Severity of Illness Index"]}

However, its impact on diagnostic yield remains uncertain, and there are potential concerns regarding its safety too. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the same. We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar for studies evaluating the performance of pleural cryobiopsy, assessing the quality of each study using the Quality Assessment, Data Abstraction and Synthesis-2 tool. Using inverse variance weighting, we performed a meta-analysis of diagnostic yield estimations. We also reviewed specimen characteristics and complications related to the procedure. Seven observational studies involving 586 pleural biopsies (311 cryobiopsies and 275 flexible forceps biopsies) were evaluated. All but one study used a semi-rigid thoracoscope. Meta-analysis generated a diagnostic yield of 96.5% for cryobiopsy and 93.1% for forceps biopsy with an inverse variance-weighted OR of 1.61 (95% CI, 0.71-3.66) and an I2 of 16%. No instances of moderate to severe bleeding were reported with cryobiopsy. A funnel plot illustrated no major publication bias. Based on analysis of relatively homogenous observational data, pleural cryobiopsy is safe but does not increase diagnostic yield over flexible forceps biopsy.

We reviewed a large single surgeon experience identifying three different methods of analgesia used over time to highlight marked improvement in patient LOS. IRB approval was obtained and patient clinical information was retrospectively reviewed from 2001 to 2017. The primary outcome variable was length of hospital stay. An expanded preoperative consultation reviews the issue of pain, the negative impact of anxiety on recovery, and our current success of shortened hospital stays with our patients. One hundred and seventy-three patients representing three different analgesia approaches had a LOS of 4.4 days (epidural); 2.2 days (PCA/intercostal nerve block); and 1.6 days (scheduled oral pain meds/intercostal nerve blocks). The current LOS for patients is 1.0 day. Patients successfully stop using narcotics by the end of the first week postoperatively. Intraoperative intercostal nerve blocks, scheduled postoperative pain medications, and enhanced preoperative consultation aimed to educate patients about anxiety and reframe patient pain expectations have collectively decreased LOS, and reduced postoperative narcotic usage.

Therapeutic anesthetic options primarily include patient-controlled intravenous analgesia, thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA), and cryoanalgesia. However, TEA is limited to inpatient use and both TEA and cryoanalgesia can result in neurologic injury. The novel technique of ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane regional analgesia has been used recently in our patients undergoing the Nuss repair and has shown impressive pain relief, but without the potential complications of other modalities. Erector spinae plane block (ESPB) postoperative pain management outcomes were studied as compared to TEA. Thirty consecutive patients with severe pectus excavatum undergoing Nuss repair and placement of ultrasound-guided ESPB were each paired to a historical cohort control patient with TEA postoperative pain management. The cohort patient match was defined by age (± 2 years), gender, and CT pectus index (± 15%). Study variables included hospital length of stay (LOS), pain scores, and pain medication usage. Pain scores as measured by area under the curve per hour (Day 1: 2.72 (SD = 1.37) vs. 3.90 (SD = 1.81), P = 0.006; Day 2: 2.83 (SD = 1.32) vs. 3.97 (SD = 1.82), P = 0.007) and oral morphine equivalent (OME) pain medication usage (Day 1: 11.9 (SD = 4.9) vs 56.0 (SD = 32.2), P < 0.001; Day 2: 14.7 (SD = 7.1) vs. 38.0 (SD = 21.7), P < 0.001) were higher for the first two postoperative days in the ESPB group. However, mean hospital LOS was nearly one day shorter for ESPB patients (3.78 (SD = 0.82) vs. 2.90 (SD = 0.87), P < 0.001) who were discharged home with the catheter in place until removal, typically at 5-7 days postoperatively. Ultrasound-guided ESPB is thus a feasible, safe, and effective alternative to TEA in postoperative pain management after Nuss repair and results in decreased hospital stay. III.

Depending on the severity, presentation varies from mild cosmetic complaints to life limiting cardiopulmonary symptoms. Patients may develop symptoms as they age, and these symptoms may worsen over the years. A technique for minimally invasive repair for pectus excavatum (MIRPE) was introduced with the concept of temporarily implanting metal bars to correct the deformity. This has rapidly become the standard of care for the pediatric and adolescent patients. The use of MIRPE in adults, however, has been slower to adopt and more controversial. This is largely due to the increased calcification and rigidity of the chest wall in adults which can make the repair more complex and lead to a higher risk of complications. We present a literature review of the presentation, workup, and surgical treatment of adult patients with Pex undergoing MIRPE. Adult patients can, with advanced preoperative evaluations and technique modifications, undergo a highly successful repair resulting in symptom resolution and satisfying results. 2023 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

From June 2009 to June 2010, a total of 160 patients who underwent posterolateral thoracotomy and oesophagectomy were subsequently recruited to our study and divided into NIMF groups and INC groups at random. Patient follow-up studies were conducted for one year on all the subjects and the resultant postoperative pain, chronic pain, rehabilitation and complication scored were measured and documented. INC treatment was more time-intensive than NIMF treatment (P < 0.05). Also, additional chest tube drainage and subsequent extubation were often necessary in the INC group (P < 0.001). No statistically significant differences were found between the two groups regarding the number of subjects who required oral medication one month postoperative with respect to pain score. The chronic pain level, as well as the number of patients requiring oral pain medication, increased significantly by the sixth month following operation and notably increased until the 12th postoperative month in the INC group (P < 0.05).

Patient characteristics, intraoperative data, and data on clinical course were collected. Patients were divided into those who underwent INC and those who underwent routine care for comparison. Twenty-six patients underwent 38 procedures at a median age of 16 years (range 5-21 years). INC was performed in 23 cases over a median of five intercostal levels (range 2-7). Total oral morphine equivalents during inpatient admission were significantly lower in INC patients (137.6 vs. 514.5 mg, p = .002).

From 1987 to 1996, 148 patients were evaluated for chest wall deformity. Fifty of 127 patients suffering from pectus excavatum were selected for surgical correction. Eight older patients underwent the Ravitch procedure, and 42 patients under age 15 were treated by the minimally invasive technique. A convex steel bar is inserted under the sternum through small bilateral thoracic incisions. The steel bar is inserted with the convexity facing posteriorly, and when it is in position, the bar is turned over, thereby correcting the deformity. After 2 years, when permanent remolding has occurred, the bar is removed in an outpatient procedure. Of 42 patients who had the minimally invasive procedure, 30 have undergone bar removal. Initial excellent results were maintained in 22, good results in four, fair in two, and poor in two, with mean follow-up since surgery of 4.6 years (range, 1 to 9.2 years). Mean follow-up since bar removal is 2.8 years (range, 6 months to 7 years). Average blood loss was 15 mL. Average length of hospital stay was 4.3 days. Patients returned to full activity after 1 month. Complications were pneumothorax in four patients, requiring thoracostomy in one patient; superficial wound infection in one patient; and displacement of the steel bar requiring revision in two patients. The fair and poor results occurred early in the series because (1) the bar was too soft (three patients), (2) the sternum was too soft in one of the patients with Marfan's syndrome, and (3) in one patient with complex thoracic anomalies, the bar was removed too soon. This minimally invasive technique, which requires neither cartilage incision nor resection, is effective.

The proposed ultrasound-guided technique positions multi-perforated soaker catheter deep to the paraspinal muscles from T2 to T11. The project was conducted in two phases. First, a cadaveric dissection was performed to establish the pathway of spread of local anesthetic in vivo. Second, a pilot double blind randomized control project was conducted to evaluate effectiveness of the technique in ten patients and to derive parameters necessary for the definitive future study. Outcomes were evaluated based on the narcotic requirement, pain scores and functional measures. Placement of the catheters in two cadavers demonstrated reliable positioning in the subparaspinal tissue plane, and multilevel dye spread along the intercostal nerve path. In addition, a potential route of spread toward the paravertebral space along the canal accommodating dorsal ramus of the thoracic nerve was demonstrated.

Still, is associated with potential major complications that are in part believed to be preventable as they might be the consequence of institutional case-volume differences. The objective is to evaluate the presence of a volume-outcome relation for the Nuss procedure and determine the optimal annual institutional case-volume threshold, defining high-volume centers. A systematic literature search was performed, considering studies from unique centers reporting on pectus excavatum patients who underwent the Nuss procedure. Primary and secondary outcomes were, respectively: the incidence of significant perioperative complications (Clavien-Dindo ≥ grade-III and significant intraoperative complications) and bar displacement. The presence of a non-linear volume-outcome relation was evaluated through restricted-cubic-spline-analyses. If present, the optimal annual institutional case-volume was determined by the elbow method. Forty-nine studies from 49 unique centers were included, enrolling 13,352 patients in total. The significant perioperative complication rate was low [7.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 6.4-9.0%] and demonstrated a significant non-linear volume-outcome relation (P<0.001), even after covariate adjustment. The optimal annual institutional case-volume was determined at 73 cases/year (95% CI: 67-89). In this scenario, the number needed to treat to prevent a single perioperative complication compared to a low volume center was 11 (95% CI: 8-19). A similar volume-outcome relation (P<0.001) and optimal case volume of 73 cases/year was observed for bar displacement. A significant volume-outcome relation for repair of pectus excavatum by the Nuss procedure exists with an optimal annual institutional case-volume of 73 cases/year. These findings provide rationale for centralization. 2024 AME Publishing Company. All rights reserved.", "mesh": []}

Patients were randomized into three groups: A (control group), B (epidural analgesia), C (freezing of intercostal nerves). Subjective pain relief was assessed on a linear visual analog scale. Analgesic requirements were evaluated during the 12 days following surgery, or until discharge if earlier. The vital capacity (VC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were measured on the day before operation and on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 7th postoperative days (POD). Subjective pain relief was significantly better in Group B in comparison with Group A (P < 0.05) or C (P < 0.05). Group C had the lowest score on the 11th and 12th POD but differences were not statistically significant. Requirements for intravenous analgesics were lower in Group B than in the control group (P < 0.05) during the first 3 POD, and in group C than in the control group the day of operation (P < 0.05). Oral analgesic requirements, when compared with controls, were lower in group B during the first 5 POD, and lower in group C on the 3rd and the 4th POD (P < 0.05). Cryoanalgesia led to a slight but not significant increase in VC and FEV1. Epidural analgesia led to a significant increase when compared with controls in FEV1 during the first 3 POD, and in FVC on the 7th POD (P < 0.05). It is concluded that epidural analgesia led to the best pain relief and restoration of pulmonary function after thoracotomy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", "mesh": ["Analgesia, Epidural", "Elective Surgical Procedures", "Forced Expiratory Volume", "Humans", "Hypothermia, Induced", "Intercostal Nerves", "Middle Aged", "Pain Measurement", "Pain, Postoperative", "Prospective Studies", "Respiratory Function Tests", "Thoracotomy", "Vital Capacity"]}

Many current therapies have dose-limiting adverse effects and are limited by their short duration of action. This review examines the evidence for the efficacy and safety of cryoanalgesia in postoperative pain. This review was registered in PROSPERO and prepared in accordance with PRISMA. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched until July 2020. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults evaluating perioperatively administered cryoanalgesia for postoperative pain relief. Twenty-four RCTS were included. Twenty studies examined cryoanalgesia for thoracotomy, two for herniorrhaphy, one for nephrectomy and one for tonsillectomy. Meta-analysis was performed for thoracic studies. We found that cryoanalgesia with opioids was more efficacious than opioid analgesia alone for acute pain (mean difference [MD] 2.32 units, 95 % confidence interval [CI] -3.35 to -1.30) and persistent pain (MD 0.81 units, 95 % CI -1.10 to -0.53) after thoracotomy. Cryoanalgesia with opioids also resulted in less postoperative nausea compared to opioid analgesia alone (relative risk [RR] 0.23, 95 % CI 0.06 to 0.95), but there was no difference in atelectasis (RR 0.38, 95 % CI 0.07 to 2.17). Heterogeneity in comparators and outcomes were important limitations. In general, reporting of adverse events was incomplete and inconsistent. Many studies were over two decades old, and most were limited in how they described their methodology. Considering the potential, larger RCTs should be performed to better understand the role of cryoanalgesia in postoperative pain management. © 2021 The Authors.

We aimed to report our experience using a standardized perioperative approach including Cryo during MIRPE, and compare our actual results with those of a previous thoracic epidural analgesia (TE) cohort. Lessons learned are summarized. Retrospective study including patients undergoing Cryo during MIRPE between October 2018 and May 2023. Results with a standardized perioperative approach were analyzed. We then compared our Cryo cohort with a previous cohort of 62 patients who underwent TE and MIRPE between 2013 and 2018. Continuous variables were reported as mean and standard deviation, and as median (interquartile range) for variables with non-uniform distribution. We performed 176 Cryo during MIRPE (16.8 ± 4.6 years), with a mean postoperative length of stay (LOS) of 1.4 ± 0.8 days and a median total requirement of 7.5 (0.0; 15.0) oral morphine equivalents (OME) (mg). Patients with Cryo had a significantly lower mean LOS (1.4 ± 0.8 vs. 3.6 ± 1.0 days, p < 0.0001), and median total opioid requirement [7.5 (0.0; 15.0) vs. 77.4 (27.0; 115.5 OME (mg), p < 0.0001) compared to TE patients. Lessons learned included ensuring adequate contact of the cryoprobe with the target, proper exposition, and specialized multidisciplinary perioperative patient and family support, including psychology and physical therapy. In this study, we reported lessons learned after performing a standardized protocol of perioperative care in patients undergoing Cryo during MIRPE. This protocol enabled the achievement of a short LOS and low postoperative opioid requirement. Retrospective comparative study. III. Copyright © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of this study was to quantify long-term hypoesthesia and neuropathic pain after MIRPE with Cryo. A prospective cohort study was conducted single-institution of patients ≤21 years who presented for bar removal. Consented patients underwent chest wall sensory testing and completed neuropathic pain screening. Chest wall hypoesthesia to cold, soft touch, and pinprick were measured as the percent of the treated anterior chest wall surface area (TACWSA); neuropathic pain was evaluated by questionnaire. The study enrolled 47 patients; 87% male; median age 18.4 years. The median bar dwell time was 2.9 years. A median of 2 bars were placed; 80.9% were secured with pericostal sutures. At enrollment, 46.8% of patients had identifiable chest wall hypoesthesia. The mean percentage of TACWSA with hypoesthesia was 4.7 ± 9.3% (cold), 3.9 ± 7.7% (soft touch), and 5.9 ± 11.8% (pinprick). Hypoesthesia to cold was found in 0 dermatomes in 62%, 1 dermatome in 11%, 2 dermatomes in 17% and ≥3 dermatomes in 11%. T5 was the most common dermatome with hypoesthesia. Neuropathic symptoms were identified by 13% of patients; none required treatment. In long-term follow up after MIRPE with Cryo, 46.8% of patients experienced some chest wall hypoesthesia; the average TACWSA with hypoesthesia was 4-6%.

{"pmid": 21107118, "title": "Twenty-one years of experience with minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum by the Nuss procedure in 1215 patients.", "abstract": "To review the technical improvements and changes in management that have occurred over 21 years, which have made the minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum safer and more successful. In 1997, we reported our 10-year experience with a new minimally invasive technique for surgical correction of pectus excavatum in 42 children. Since then, we have treated an additional 1173 patients, and in this report, we summarize the technical modifications which have made the repair safer and more successful. From January 1987 to December 2008, we evaluated 2378 pectus excavatum patients. We established criteria for surgical intervention, and patients with a clinically and objectively severe deformity were offered surgical correction. The objective criteria used for surgical correction included computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest, resting pulmonary function studies (spirometry and/or plethysmography), and a cardiology evaluation which included echocardiogram and electrocardiogram. Surgery was indicated if the patients were symptomatic, had a severe pectus excavatum on a clinical basis and fulfilled two or more of the following: CT index greater than 3.25, evidence of cardiac or pulmonary compression on CT or echocardiogram, mitral valve prolapse, arrhythmia, or restrictive lung disease. Data regarding evaluation, treatment, and follow up have been prospectively recorded since 1994. Surgical repair was performed in 1215 (51%) of 2378 patients evaluated. Of these, 1123 were primary repairs, and 92 were redo operations. Bars have been removed from 854 patients; 790 after primary repair operations, and 64 after redo operations. The mean Haller CT index was 5.15 ± 2.32 (mean ± SD). Pulmonary function studies performed in 739 patients showed that FVC, FEV1, and FEF25-75 values were decreased by a mean of 15% below predicted value. Mitral valve prolapse was present in 18% (216) of 1215 patients and arrhythmias in 16% (194). Of patients who underwent surgery, 2.8% (35 patients) had genetically confirmed Marfan syndrome and an additional 17.8% (232 patients) had physical features suggestive of Marfan syndrome. Scoliosis was noted in 28% (340). At primary operation, 1 bar was placed in 69% (775 patients), 2 bars in 30% (338), and 3 bars in 0.4% (4). Complications decreased markedly over 21 years. In primary operation patients, the bar displacement rate requiring surgical repositioning decreased from 12% in the first decade to 1% in the second decade. Allergy to nickel was identified in 2.8% (35 patients) of whom 22 identified preoperatively received a titanium bar, 10 patients were treated successfully with prednisone and 3 required bar removal: 2 were switched to a titanium bar, and 1 required no further treatment. Wound infection occurred in 1.4% (17 patients), of whom 4 required surgical drainage (0.4% of the total). Hemothorax occurred in 0.6% (8 patients); 4 during the postoperative period and four occurred late. Postoperative pulmonary function testing has shown significant improvement. A good or excellent anatomic surgical outcome was achieved in 95.8% of patients at the time of bar removal. A fair result occurred in 1.4%, poor in 0.8%, and recurrence of sufficient severity to require reoperation occurred in 11 primary surgical patients (1.4%). Five patients (0.6%) had their bars removed elsewhere. In the 752 patients, more than 1 year post bar removal, the mean time from initial operation to last follow up was 1341 ± 28 days (SEM), and time from bar removal to last follow-up is 854 ± 51 days. Age at operation has shifted from a median age of 6 years (range 1-15) in the original report to 14 years (range 1-31). The minimally invasive procedure has been successfully performed in 253 adult patients aged 18 to 31 years of age. The minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum has been performed safely and effectively in 1215 patients with a 95.8% good to excellent anatomic result in the primary repairs at our institution.", "mesh": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Funnel Chest", "Humans", "Infant", "Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Young Adult"]}

While various methods have been proposed to address these issues, none have been commonly effective. In this case report, we attempted to simultaneously address these problems by performing intercostal cryoablation (IC) and mesh repair. A 43-year-old male was referred to our hospital for chronic post-thoracotomy neuralgia following heart surgery via MT, involving patch closure of an atrial septal defect and tricuspid annuloplasty. He presented with intercostal nerve neuralgia and lung herniation accompanied by severe pain. Despite medication and lidocaine injections, there was no relief. Consequently, he underwent surgical treatment with IC for chronic MT wound pain and simultaneously underwent mesh repair for a lung hernia. He was discharged from hospital free of complications. Subsequently, he no longer required further pain medication and experienced a favorable recovery. Our findings suggest that concurrent IC and mesh repair can effectively relieve chronic post-MT intercostal nerve neuralgia and severe lung herniation pain in patients who underwent MT surgery, leading to a decrease in opioid medication usage. © 2024.

Pectus excavatum, the most common anterior chest deformity, is characterized by sternal depression with corresponding leftward displacement and rotation of the heart. Pectus carinatum, the second most common, exhibits a variety of chest wall protrusions and very diverse clinical manifestations. The cause of these conditions is thought to be abnormal elongation of the costal cartilages. Collagen, as a major structural component of rib cartilage, is implicated by genetic and histologic analysis. Poland syndrome is a unique unilateral chest/hand deficiency that may include rib defects, pectoral muscle deficit, and syndactyly. Cleft sternum is a rare congenital defect resulting from nonfusion of the sternal halves, which leaves the heart unprotected and requires early surgical intervention.", "mesh": ["Funnel Chest", "Genetic Predisposition to Disease", "Humans", "Musculoskeletal Abnormalities", "Poland Syndrome", "Sternum", "Thoracic Surgical Procedures", "Thoracic Wall"]}

Promising results have been reported for cryoanalgesia following MIRPE; however, its invasiveness, single-lung ventilation, and additional instrumentation requirements remain obstacles. Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) is a regional block technique capable of covering the anterior chest wall at the T2-9 levels, which are affected by MIRPE. We hypothesized that SAPB would be a superior alternative pain control modality that reduces postoperative pain more effectively than conventional methods. We conducted a retrospective study of patients who underwent MIRPE between March 2022 and August 2023. The efficacy of pain control was compared between group N (conventional pain management, n=24) and group S (SAPB, n=26). Group N received intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) and subcutaneous local anesthetic infusion. Group S received bilateral continuous SAPB with 0.3% ropivacaine after a bilateral bolus injection of 30 mL of 0.25% ropivacaine with baseline IV-PCA. Pain levels were evaluated using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively and total intravenous rescue analgesic consumption by morphine milligram equivalents (MME). Mean VAS scores were significantly lower in group S than in group N throughout the 72-hour postoperative period (p<0.01). Group S showed significantly lower MME at postoperative 72 hours (group N: 108.53, group S: 16.61; p<0.01). SAPB improved immediate postoperative pain control in both the resting and dynamic states and reduced opioid consumption compared to conventional management.", "mesh": []}

Surveys were administered to patients who underwent bar placement for pectus excavatum with intercostal nerve cryoablation from 2017 to 2021 regarding pain scores, pain medication usage, and limitations to activity beginning on the day of surgery, on the day of discharge, and at two-week and three-month follow-up. Of 110 patients, forty-eight (44%) completed the discharge survey; sharp pain and pressure on the first postoperative night were the most described pain characteristics, most frequently in the middle of the chest. On follow-up, 55% of patients reported tolerable residual pain at two weeks and 41% at three months, with 25% requiring intermittent pain medication at three months. There were three readmissions for inadequate pain control and 110 calls to the surgery clinic by three-month follow-up, most commonly for persistent pain and frequent popping sensation with movement. Although cryoablation is an excellent pain control modality, these data suggest that patients underreport functional symptoms and experience more frequent discomfort and alteration of daily living activities.

The Pediatric Health Information System database was queried for pectus excavatum patients aged 9-21 who underwent MIRPE between 2016 and 2023. Concurrent cryoablation use was identified using billing/supply codes. Temporal trends in cryoablation utilization were described and quantified using linear regression. Demographics, resource utilization, and outcomes were compared for patients based on cryoablation utilization using chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Predictors of cryoablation use were evaluated with logistic regression. This analysis included 2068 patients (mean age 15 ± 1.8 years; 86 % male). Cryoablation utilization increased from 33 % to 61 % from 2016 to 2023, with a strong positive trend (R2 = 0.73).

This study aimed to determine how INC affected the operative time, length of stay, complication rates, inpatient opioid use, and outpatient prescription of opioids at a single center. A retrospective review was performed at a single pediatric referral center of all patients who underwent MIRPE between 2018 and 2023. Patient demographics, operative details, and perioperative course were collected. The use of INC versus PVB was recorded.

Most centers use two-minute cryoablation per level, although data from histologic and adult studies suggest the effectiveness of one-minute freezes. We aimed to describe our center's experience with one minute per level cryoablation. A retrospective single institution review of patients undergoing SCOPE was performed to compare patients pre- and post-intercostal nerve cryoablation implementation. Cryoablation was performed as one minute for each of the thoracic intercostal nerves T3-T7. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted to compare the outcomes and cost between pre- and post-implementation groups. During the study period, 198 patients underwent SCOPE with one Nuss bar, receiving either intraoperative intercostal nerve cryoablation (Cryo, n = 100) or preoperative thoracic paravertebral catheters (NoCryo, n = 98). Surgical time was on average 9 min longer for the Cryo group (p<0.01). Median length of stay for the Cryo group was 3 days shorter compared to the NoCryo group (p<0.01). The Cryo group had a 19-fold and 5.6-fold reduction in average inpatient and total postoperative opioid usage, respectively (p<0.01). Total hospital costs were significantly lower in the Cryo group (p<0.01). Overall complication rate was not statistically significant different between the two groups. Intraoperative one minute per level cryoablation is a potent approach to postoperative analgesia for SCOPE patients that led to a shorter hospital length of stay, lower hospital costs, and decreased opioid use compared to conventional analgesia at our institution. Pediatric surgeons performing correction of chest wall deformities should consider offering this technique. Copyright © 2022.

We performed a single-center retrospective cohort study of adult lung transplant recipients from August 2017 to September 2018. We compared outcomes of patients who received intraoperative cryoablation of the intercostal nerves with those who did not. Primary outcomes were postoperative patient-reported pain scores and opioid use. Secondary outcomes included postoperative sedation and agitation levels and perioperative outcomes. Data were abstracted from patients' electronic health records. Of the 102 patients transplanted, 45 received intraoperative cryoablation (intervention group) and 57 received the standard of care, which did not include intercostal or serratus blocks or immediate postoperative epidural placement (control group). The intervention group had significantly lower median and maximum postoperative pain scores at days 3 and 7 and significantly lower oral opioid use at days 3, 7, and 14 compared with the control group. Chronic opioid use at 3 and 6 months' posttransplant was lower in the intervention group. Differences in perioperative outcomes, including length of mechanical ventilation, sedation and agitation levels, and hospital stay, were not clinically meaningful. Survival at 30 days and 1 year was superior in the intervention compared with the control group.

There is poor evidence regarding the possibility that even in pediatric patients, thoracotomy can be followed by post-operative pain. The primary objective of this analysis is to identify associations with home pain therapy, pain intensity, and possible protective factors acting on chronic pain in this population. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesù IRCCS. The study included pediatric patients undergoing thoracotomy. For statistical analyses, a logistic model and a zero-inflated strategy were implemented to explore associations and predict factors related to home-based analgesic therapy and pain intensity. Gender and age were identified as significant factors in the assignment of home therapy, with males having over seven times the risk compared to females (OR = 7.06, 95% CI = [2.11, 29.7]). At the last measurement, pain intensity was positively associated with age and the number of pain events during the week. The study highlights significant factors influencing post-thoracotomy pain management in pediatric patients. These findings underscore the importance of tailored pain management strategies that consider gender and age to improve post-operative care and outcomes in pediatric thoracotomy patients. © 2024.

This is a prospective observational study to evaluate the compliance of an ERAS protocol for pectus repair at a large academic children's hospital. Our primary outcome was overall protocol compliance at 1-y postimplementation of the ERAS protocol. Our comparison group included all pectus repairs for 2 y before protocol implementation. Overall protocol compliance at 12 mo was 89%. Of the 16 pectus repairs included in the ERAS protocol group, 94% (n = 15) and 94% (n = 15) received preoperative acetaminophen and gabapentin, respectively, which was significantly greater than the historical control group (P < 0.001). For the intraoperative components analyzed, only the intrathecal morphine was significantly different than historical controls (100% versus 49%, P < 0.001). Postoperatively, the time from operating room to return to normal diet was shorter for the ERAS group (0.53 d versus 1.16 d, P < 0.001). There was no significant difference in readmission rates between the two groups. ERAS protocol compliance varies based on phase of care. Solutions to sustain protocols depend on the institution and the patient population. However, the utilization of implementation science fundamentals was invaluable in this study to identify and address areas for improvement in protocol compliance. Other institutions may adapt these strategies to improve protocol compliance at their centers. Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

Intercostal nerve cryoablation (INCA) offers targeted, prolonged pain relief for these patients. Over the last decade, more patients have undergone surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) after injury. However, data on INCA use in SSRF patients are limited. This study aimed to identify the relationship of INCA in blunt trauma patients (BTPs) undergoing SSRF, hypothesizing INCA coupled with SSRF would decrease hospital length of stay (LOS). The Trauma Quality Improvement Program database (2017-2021) was queried for BTPs ≥18 y old who underwent SSRF. Patients who received INCA ((+)INCA) were compared to patients who did not ((-)INCA). The primary outcome was LOS. Secondary outcomes included intensive care unit (ICU) LOS and in-hospital complications. A subgroup analysis of only flail chest patients was performed. From 15,784 BTPs, 750 (4.8%) received INCA. Hospital LOS was similar between groups (12 versus 12 d, P = 0.10); however, the (+)INCA patients had decreased ICU LOS (6 versus 7 d, P < 0.001). The (+)INCA cohort also had decreased hospital complications (20.4% versus 24.4%, P = 0.01), including pulmonary embolism (0.7% versus 1.8%, P = 0.02) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (2.1% versus 3.8%, P = 0.02). On subgroup analysis of flail chest patients, decreased ICU LOS in the (+)INCA patients remained a significant outcome (7 versus 8 d, P = 0.02). Nearly 5% of SSRF patients received INCA. While overall LOS was similar, the (+)INCA cohort had decreased ICU LOS and in-hospital complications. Future studies are needed to corroborate these findings and evaluate any long-term complications associated with INCA before widespread adoption. Copyright © 2024 The Authors.

MIRPE entails significant pain management challenges, often requiring high postoperative opioid use. Cryoanalgesia, which blocks pain signals by temporarily ablating intercostal nerves, has been recently utilized as an analgesic adjunct. We hypothesized that the use of cryoanalgesia during MIRPE would decrease postoperative opioid use and length of stay (LOS). A multicenter retrospective cohort study of 20 US children's hospitals was conducted of children (age below 18 years) undergoing MIRPE from January 1, 2014, to August 1, 2019. Differences in total postoperative, inpatient, oral morphine equivalents per kilogram, and 30-day LOS between patients who received cryoanalgesia versus those who did not were assessed using bivariate and multivariable analysis. P value <0.05 is considered significant. Of 898 patients, 136 (15%) received cryoanalgesia. Groups were similar by age, sex, body mass index, comorbidities, and Haller index. Receipt of cryoanalgesia was associated with lower oral morphine equivalents per kilogram (risk ratio=0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.33-0.57) and a shorter LOS (risk ratio=0.66, 95% confidence interval: 0.50-0.87). Complications were similar between groups (29.8% vs 22.1, P =0.07), including a similar rate of emergency department visit, readmission, and/or reoperation. Use of cryoanalgesia during MIRPE appears to be effective in lowering postoperative opioid requirements and LOS without increasing complication rates. With the exception of preoperative gabapentin, other adjuncts appear to increase and/or be ineffective at reducing opioid utilization. Cryoanalgesia should be considered for patients undergoing this surgery. Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We designed this prospective, randomized trial to compare postoperative pain management and outcomes between thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) and bilateral subcutaneous infusion pump catheters (On-Q). Patients undergoing MIRPE (modified Nuss) underwent random assignment to TEA or On-Q group. Both groups received intravenous, patient-controlled opioid analgesia, with concomitant delivery of local anesthetic. Primary outcomes were length of stay (LOS), opioid use, and pain scores. Of 85 randomly assigned patients, 68 completed the study [52 men, 76.5%; mean (range) age, 32.2 (20.0-58.0) years; Haller index, 5.9 (range, 3.0-26.7)]. The groups were equally matched for preoperative variables; however, the On-Q arm had more patients (60.3%). No significant differences were found between groups in mean daily pain scores (P=0.52), morphine-equivalent opioid usage (P=0.28), or hospital stay 3.5 vs. 3.3 days (TEA vs. On-Q; P=0.55). Thirteen patients randomized to TEA refused the epidural and withdrew from the study because they perceived greater benefit of the On-Q system. Postoperative pain management in adults after MIRPE can be difficult. Both continuous local anesthetic delivery by TEA and On-Q catheters with concomitant, intravenous, patient-controlled anesthesia maintained acceptable analgesia with a reasonable LOS.

We recently adopted a comprehensive multimodal analgesic protocol that standardizes perioperative analgesic management.

We retrospectively compared opioid consumption, pain scores, and length of stay between a cohort of patients managed with our multimodal analgesic protocol and a cohort managed with a thoracic epidural infusion. This retrospective cohort comparison includes patients, 8 to 21 years of age, managed with either thoracic epidural infusion (n = 21) or multimodal analgesic protocol (n = 29) following minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum from January 1, 2011 through September 15, 2015. The primary outcome, total daily opioid consumption in morphine equivalents, is presented as an average by postoperative day. Secondary outcomes included median daily pain score and length of stay. Patients were similar in age, weight, sex, and physical status. Patients managed with thoracic epidural infusion received less opioid (morphine equivalents-mg/kg) intraoperatively compared to multimodal analgesic protocol (difference of mean [95% confidence interval] 0.22 [0.16-0.28] P ≤ .01) but required more total opioid through postoperative day 3 (difference of mean [95% confidence interval] 1.2 [0.26-2.14] P = .01).

Given the lack of an international consensus on guidelines for postoperative handling and evaluation, further research is necessary to compare the efficacy of existing pain management methods regarding pain relief, side effects, and long-term outcomes. In this context, the use of eHealth solutions for data mining can enhance data collection efficiency, reduce errors, and improve patient engagement. However, these digital health care frameworks are currently underused in the context of pain management for PE. This research is part of the broader Cryoanalgesia for Pain Management After Pectus Excavatum Repair (COPPER) study conducted by Giannina Gaslini Children's Hospital to address postoperative pain and recovery in PE patients treated with either standard thoracic epidural analgesia or cryoanalgesia, which is considered its innovative alternative approach. Specifically, this work is aimed at introducing a valuable tool for a comprehensive and quantitative comparison of the 2 analgesia strategies. The tool is a web and mobile app designed to facilitate data collection, management, and analysis of clinical data for pain assessment. The adopted approach involves a careful design based on clinician input, resulting in an intuitive app structure with 3 main screens. Digital surveys are borrowed from paper surveys, including medical history and preoperative, postoperative, and follow-up evaluations. XTENS 2.0 was used to manage the data, and Ionic facilitated cross-platform app development, ensuring secure and adaptable data handling. Preliminary analysis on a pilot cohort of 72 patients (36 treated with standard therapy and 36 treated with cryoanalgesia) indicated successful patient enrollment and balanced representation across treatment groups and genders. Notably, hospital stay was significantly shorter with cryoanalgesia than with standard therapy (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon 2-sided test with Bonferroni correction; P<.001; U statistic=287.5), validating its treatment efficacy. This work is a step toward modernizing health care through digital transformation and patient-centered models. The app shows promise in streamlined data collection and patient engagement, although improvements in multilingual support, data validation, and incentivization of questionnaire completion are warranted. Overall, this study highlights the potential of digital health solutions in revolutionizing health care practices, fostering patient involvement, and improving care quality. ©Rosella Trò, Angelica Orecchia, Nicola Disma, Paolo Uva, Roberto Cavanna, Nicolò Zanardi, Michele Torre, Marco Massimo Fato.

We aimed to determine the energy flux from a maximally cooled cryoprobe and model the possible effects on a whole-body system. To directly measure energy flux, a maximally cooled cryoSPHERE probe (AtriCure, Inc, Mason, OH) was isolated in a well-mixed water bath at 37°C. Real-time temperatures were recorded. Three models were created to estimate intraoperative flux. Perioperative temperatures of 50 patients who received cryoablation during SCOPE were compared to 50 patients who did not receive cryoablation. Direct calorimetry measured average energy flux of the maximally cooled cryoprobe to be 28 J/s. Thermodynamic modeling demonstrated the following: 1) The highest possible cryoprobe flux is less than estimated basal metabolic rate (BMR) of the average teenager undergoing SCOPE and 2) Flux in a best model of human tissue energy transfer using available literature is far less than the effects of BMR and insensible losses. Clinically, there were no significant differences in the minimum intraoperative, end procedure or first postoperative body temperatures for patients who received cryoablation and those who did not. Cryoprobe flux is significantly fewer joules per second than BMR. Furthermore, in a clinical series there were no empiric differences in body temperature due to cryoablation employment, contradicting concerns regarding hypothermia secondary to cryoablation.

Although several alternative forms of post-thoracotomy analgesia exist, all have their disadvantages. Cryoanalgesia, localized freezing of intercostal nerves, has been reported to have variable effectiveness and an incidence of long-term cutaneous sensory changes. We carried out an animal study to assess the reversibility of histological changes induced by cryoanalgesia and a prospective randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of cryoanalgesia with conventional analgesia (parenteral opiates). In six anaesthetized dogs, intercostal nerves were exposed to a varying duration of cryo-application (30, 60, 90 and 120 s). The nerves were biopsied and examined histologically at regular intervals over the following 6 months. In the clinical study, 200 consecutive patients undergoing thoracotomy were randomized to cryoanalgesia and conventional (parenteral opiates) analgesia groups. Postoperative pain scores, respiratory function tests and use of opiate analgesia were measured for the two groups. Following application of the cryoprobe, degeneration and fragmentation of the axons was evident with associated inflammatory changes. As the endoneurium remained intact, axonal regeneration took place after the resolution of axonal swelling. Over the course of weeks, recovery of the intercostal nerve occurred and was complete after 1 month for the 30 and 60 s groups. For nerves exposed to longer durations of cryoanalgesia, the time taken for complete recovery was proportionally increased. Clinically, there was a statistically significant (P<0.05) improvement in postoperative pain scores and use of opiate analgesia and an improvement (P>0.05) in respiratory function tests for patients in the cryoanalgesia group. The previously suggested cutaneous sensory changes resolved within 6 months with complete restoration of function. We suggest that cryoanalgesia be considered as a simple, inexpensive, long-term form of post-thoracotomy pain relief, which does not cause any long-term histological damage to intercostal nerves.", "mesh": ["Adult", "Aged", "Analgesics, Opioid", "Animals", "Axons", "Dogs", "Female", "Humans", "Hypothermia, Induced", "Intercostal Nerves", "Male", "Meperidine", "Middle Aged", "Pain Measurement", "Pain, Postoperative", "Prospective Studies", "Thoracotomy"]}

A retrospective review of 498 patients (502 procedures) who underwent RATS (74), VATS (227), and open (201) anatomic pulmonary resection including lobectomy and segmentectomy from 2010 to 2014 was performed to identify factors related to acute and chronic pain. Acute pain scores were analyzed over the first 9 postoperative days. Chronic pain was assessed using the validated PainDETECT survey. There were no significant differences in acute or chronic pain between RATS and VATS. There was a significant decrease in acute pain for patients with minimally invasive surgery (P = .0004). Chronic numbness was significantly higher after open resection (25.5% vs 11.6%; P = .0269) but with no difference in other symptoms of chronic pain.

Our study evaluates the efficacy and safety of cryoablation in pain management of pediatric cancer patients undergoing thoracotomy. We reviewed cancer patients undergoing thoracotomies for pulmonary metastasis resection at our children's hospital from 2017 to 2023. Patients who received cryoablation were compared to those who did not. Our primary outcomes were self-reported postoperative pain scores (from 0 to 10) and opioid consumption, measured as oral morphine equivalent per kilogram. Thirty eight procedures were performed in 17 patients, of which 11 (64.7%) were males. Cryoablation was used in 14 (32.4%) procedures, while it was not in 24 (67.6%). Median age (17 y in both groups, P = 0.84) and length of surgery (300 cryoablation versus 282 no cryoablation, P = 0.65) were similar between the groups. Patients treated with cryoablation had a shorter hospital stay compared to those who did not (3.0 versus 4.5 d, respectively, P = 0.04) and received a lower total dose of opioids (2.2 oral morphine equivalent per kilogram versus 14.4, P = 0.004). No significant difference was noted in daily pain scores between the two groups (3.8 cryoablation versus 3.9 no cryoablation, P = 0.93). There was no difference in rates of readmissions between the cryoablation and no-cryoablation groups (14.3% versus 8.3%, P = 0.55). Our study suggests that cryoablation of the thoracic nerves during a thoracotomy is associated with reduced opiate consumption and shorter hospital stay.

Due to an institutional change in clinical management, we were able to perform a before and after study. Twenty patients undergoing Nuss procedure who received bilateral ultrasound-guided single-shot T6 level ESP blocks and intercostal nerve cryoablation were compared with a historical control cohort of 20 patients who underwent Nuss procedure with intercostal nerve cryoablation alone. The primary outcome variables included postoperative pain scores, total hospital opioid use, and hospital length of stay. Median total hospital intravenous morphine milligram equivalents was lower for the ESP group than for the control group (0.60 (IQR 0.35-0.88) vs 1.15 mg/kg (IQR 0.74-1.68), p<0.01). There was no difference in postoperative pain scores between the two groups. Mean hospital length of stay was 2.45 (SD 0.69) days for the control group and 1.95 (SD 0.69) days for the ESP group (p=0.03). No adverse events related to block placement were identified.

Upon peripheral nerve injury, a large number of macrophages are accumulated at the injury sites, where they not only contribute to Wallerian degeneration, but also are educated by the local microenvironment and polarized to an anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2), thus contributing to axonal regeneration. Significant progress has been made in understanding how macrophages are educated and polarized in the injured microenvironment as well as how they contribute to axonal regeneration. Following the discussion on the main properties of macrophages and their phenotypes, in this review, we will summarize the current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of macrophage infiltration after PNS injury.

For many decades, opioids have been widely administered to target both, acute and subsequent chronic incisional pain. Opioids are potent and highly addictive drugs that can provide sufficient pain relief, but simultaneously cause unwanted effects ranging from nausea, vomiting and constipation to respiratory depression, sedation and even death. Multimodal analgesia consists of the administration of two or more medications or analgesia techniques that act by different mechanisms for providing analgesia. Thus, multimodal analgesia aims to improve pain relief while reducing opioid requirements and opioid-related side effects. Regional anesthesia techniques are an important component of this approach. For this narrative review, authors summarized currently used regional anesthesia techniques and performed an extensive literature search to summarize specific current evidence. For this, related articles from January 1985 to March 2022 were taken from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library databases. Terms such as \"pectoral nerve blocks\", \"serratus plane block\", \"erector spinae plane block\" belonging to blocks used in thoracic surgery were searched in different combinations. Potential advantages of regional anesthesia as part of multimodal analgesia regiments are reduced surgical stress response, improved analgesia, reduced opioid consumption, reduced risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting, and early mobilization. Potential disadvantages include the possibility of bleeding related to regional anesthesia procedure (particularly epidural hematoma), dural puncture with subsequent dural headache, systemic hypotension, urine retention, allergic reactions, local anesthetic toxicity, injuries to organs including pneumothorax, and a relatively high failure especially with continuous techniques. This narrative review summarizes regional anesthetic techniques, specific indications, and clinical considerations for patients undergoing thoracic surgery, with evidence from studies performed. However, there is a need for more studies comparing new block methods with standard methods so that clinical applications can increase patient satisfaction. 2022 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

However, the optimal regimen has not been identified. We describe our early experience with intercostal cryoablation for pain management in children undergoing the Nuss procedure and compare early cryoablation outcomes to our prior outcomes using thoracic epidural analgesia. A multi-institutional, retrospective review of fifty-two patients undergoing Nuss bar placement with either intercostal cryoablation (n=26) or thoracic epidural analgesia (n=26) from March 2013 to January 2016 was conducted. The primary outcome was hospital length of stay. Secondary outcomes included telemetry unit monitoring time, total intravenous narcotic use, duration of intravenous narcotic use, and postoperative complications. Patients who underwent intercostal cryoablation had a significant reduction in the mean hospital length of stay, time in a monitored telemetry bed, total use of intravenous narcotics, and the duration of intravenous narcotic administration when compared to thoracic epidural patients. Cryoablation patients had a slightly higher rate of postoperative complications. Intercostal cryoablation is a promising technique for postoperative pain management in children undergoing repair of pectus excavatum. This therapy results in reduced time to hospital discharge, decreased intravenous narcotic utilization, and has eliminated epidurals from our practice. Retrospective study - level III.

A review of the evaluation, surgical repair, and outcomes of pectus arcuatum is presented. A retrospective review of all patients undergoing surgical treatment of pectus arcuatum at a single institution was conducted between January 1, 2010, and May 31, 2024. Descriptive statistics and surgical techniques are presented. Twenty patients underwent pectus arcuatum repair (median age, 22.9 years; 55.0% males, median Haller index 2.8 [interquartile range {IQR}, 2.2, 3.6]) during the study period. Preoperatively, all patients were bothered by their chest appearance and symptomatic, with the most common symptoms being exercise intolerance (95.0%), chest pain (90.0%), and shortness of breath (90.0%). Preoperatively, cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed in almost half the patients with abnormal findings (median maximum oxygen consumption, 67.0% of predicted). A hybrid approach with sternal osteotomy and minimally invasive pectus excavatum repair was utilized in 19 out of 20 cases, with 1 case requiring sternal osteotomy only. Single wedge osteotomy was sufficient in most cases (70.0%). Median intraoperative time was 3.5 hours (IQR, 3.1, 4.2 hours). The adoption of cryoablation in 2018 significantly reduced hospital stays, from 5.0 days (IQR, 4.5, 6.0 days) to 3.0 days (IQR, 2.8, 5.0 days) (P < .001). At follow-up, all reported cosmetic satisfaction and most reported symptom improvement.

The authors examined complications in a single-institute experience of the Nuss technique to develop possible solutions to prevent them. A total of 335 consecutive patients who underwent the Nuss procedure between August 1999 and September 2002 were studied retrospectively. Median age was 8 years (range, 1 to 46). Two hundred sixty-four patients (78.8%) were in the pediatric group (age < or = 15) and 71 patients (21.2%) were in adult group (age > 15). One hundred ninety-three patients (57.6%) had symmetric and 142 patients (42.4%) had asymmetric pectus configurations. Risk factors predicting postoperative complications were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression. Postoperative complication rate was 16.1% (54 of 335) in total patients. Early complications (within a month) were pneumothorax (n = 23; 6.9%), wound seroma (n = 11; 3.3%), and bar displacement (n = 8; 2.4%).

Many different pain treatment modalities are currently being used, but none of them have been found to be ideal. In this retrospective review, we compare our current multimodal approach, which involves continuous ropivacaine infusion through chest wall catheters (CWC), intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (IV-PCA), and adjunctive medications (gabapentin and clonidine), with the technique that we used in the past, the thoracic epidural catheter (TEC). Following IRB approval, we performed a retrospective analysis of data on 32 patients who underwent the Nuss procedure at our institution. All children were divided into two groups: TEC group: 0.2% ropivacaine and hydromorphone 10 mcg·ml(-1) epidural infusion (n = 15) and CWC group (with IV-PCA and adjuncts [gabapentin + clonidine]): 0.2% ropivacaine infusion and hydromorphone PCA, oral gabapentin, and transdermal clonidine patch (n = 17). Both the groups were demographically similar. Average numeric pain scores were higher in the CWC group only on the day of surgery (mean ± sd: 3.79 ± 1.58 vs 2.68 ± 1.30; 95% CI: -2.16 to -0.05). Pain scores on postoperative day 1 (mean ± sd: 3.40 ± 1.59 vs 3.35 ± 1.32; 95% CI: -1.11 to 1.01), day 2 (mean± sd: 3.39 ± 1.79 vs 2.99 ± 1.06; 95% CI: -1.50 to 0.70), and on the day of discharge (DOD) (mean± sd: 3.25 ± 1.84 vs 3.99 ± 1.28; 95% CI: -0.42 to 1.89) were comparable between the groups.

The current study compared hospital economics, resource use, and clinical outcomes during the index stay and accompanying short-term follow-up. Patients who underwent lobectomy with standard of care treatment for postsurgical pain management and cryoablation were compared to those with standard of care treatment only. We hypothesized that cryoablation would reduce narcotic use and index hospital and short-term costs. A retrospective, propensity matched cohort of surgical patients treated between 2016 and 2022 from a US National All-Payer Database were used. Cost and outcome comparisons were made between groups using chi-square and t tests. From a cohort of 23,138 patients, 266 pairs with a mean age of 69 years were included. Matching variables included age, gender, lobe resected, and prior opioid use. Both groups had significant comorbidity history and prior opioid use; 66% (n = 175 both groups) underwent open lobectomy and 53% (n = 142 vs. 143) had the upper lobe resected. Cryoablation intervention was associated with 1.3 days reduced hospital stay (8.8 vs. 10.1 days, p = 0.31) and no difference in perioperative safety. After 90 days, postsurgery cryoablation patients had lower opioid prescription refills (27.3 vs. 36.9 morphine milligram equivalents, p = 0.03). Cryoablation patient costs trended less than non-cryoablation patients during index ($38,753 vs. $43,974, p = 0.10) and lower through 6 months (total costs, $65,703 vs. $74,304, p = 0.10). There was no difference in postsurgery resource use, but a smaller proportion of cryoablation patients had outpatient hospital visits (83.1%, N = 221 vs. 92.9%, n = 247, p < 0.01). Cryoablation during lobectomy is safe and does not add incremental hospital costs.

Intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) is a relatively new modality that involves freezing the nerves to prevent pain during recovery. Our hypothesis is that using INC for the Nuss procedure will decrease opioid use, pain scores, and length of stay (LOS) but will increase cost compared with ESP block, thoracic epidural, and PCA. This retrospective, observational study compared 108 patients who underwent the Nuss procedure at a pediatric acute care children's hospital in the southeast US. Patient charts were evaluated for significant differences in LOS, opioid use, and reported pain ratings based on type of analgesia administered: INC (n = 30), ESP block (n = 19), thoracic epidural (n = 41), and PCA (n = 18). Secondary variables included emergency department visits, readmissions, opioid refills, and various anesthetic and operative costs. Analysis of variance was performed on all outcome measures. Average LOS was significantly decreased in the INC group (2.9 days) compared with the thoracic epidural (4.7 days, p < 0.05) and the PCA groups (3.7 days, p < 0.05). Average cumulative opioid use was significantly decreased in the INC group (50.4 morphine milligram equivalents [MME]) compared with the thoracic epidural (117 MME, p < 0.05) and PCA groups (172.1 MME, p < 0.05). This study suggests that INC can be a viable and cost-effective option for reducing postoperative opioid consumption and LOS in Nuss procedure patients. Pain perception was lower in the INC group compared with the rest of the groups, except the epidurals, which were similar. However, the opioid consumption of the INC group was significantly lower than any other group. Despite the INC group having higher initial costs, it did not result in the highest total hospital charges, indicating its potential cost-effectiveness. There is a need for larger prospective randomized controlled trials to guide future research efforts. Thieme.

A rapidly growing field of research is pain management in children undergoing MIRPE, with many shifts in practice occurring over the last decade. The primary objectives of this narrative review are to describe current methods of perioperative pain management and the development of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) to improve the experience of patients undergoing MIRPE. Recent literature was found using the PubMed database using combinations of keywords: pectus excavatum, pediatric, pain management, minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE), and enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS). Literature search was conducted by the authorship team and an independent, certified librarian. Articles published in English from 2010-2024 were the focus of our review; however, older literature was included when appropriate. Perioperative pain management for patients undergoing MIRPE continues to evolve and improve patient outcomes. While evidence supports the use of more traditional analgesia, such as opioid-based or epidural analgesia, it also supports the trend toward contemporary multimodal pain control via pre-, intra-, and post-operative strategies including opioid-sparing analgesics, intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC), intercostal nerve blocks (INBs), and single or continuous infusion regional anesthesia techniques. Patients undergoing surgical repair of pectus excavatum benefit from the use of contemporary pain control techniques discussed in this review, with a growing body of literature supporting the use of INC, regional pain blocks and multimodal analgesia. Additionally, ERAS pathways and institutional protocols are discussed that are currently transforming postoperative MIRPE pain management and are being implemented widely. 2024 AME Publishing Company.

The Pediatric Regional Anesthesia Network was formed to obtain highly audited data on practice patterns and complications and to facilitate collaborative research in regional anesthetic techniques in infants and children. We constructed a centralized database to collect detailed prospective data on all regional anesthetics performed by anesthesiologists at the participating centers. Data were uploaded via a secure Internet connection to a central server. Data were rigorously audited for accuracy and errors were corrected. All anesthetic records were scrutinized to ensure that every block that was performed was captured in the database. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were tracked until their resolution. Blocks were categorized by type and as single-injection or catheter (continuous) blocks. A total of 14,917 regional blocks, performed on 13,725 patients, were accrued from April 1, 2007 through March 31, 2010. There were no deaths or complications with sequelae lasting >3 months (95% CI 0-2:10,000). Single-injection blocks had fewer adverse events than continuous blocks, although the most frequent events (33% of all events) in the latter group were catheter-related problems. Ninety-five percent of blocks were placed while patients were under general anesthesia. Single-injection caudal blocks were the most frequently performed (40%), but peripheral nerve blocks were also frequently used (35%), possibly driven by the widespread use of ultrasound (83% of upper extremity and 69% of lower extremity blocks). Regional anesthesia in children as commonly performed in the United States has a very low rate of complications, comparable to that seen in the large multicenter European studies. Ultrasound may be increasing the use of peripheral nerve blocks. Multicenter collaborative networks such as the Pediatric Regional Anesthesia Network can facilitate the collection of detailed prospective data for research and quality improvement.", "mesh": ["Adolescent", "Anesthesia, Conduction", "Anesthetics, Local", "Catheterization", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Data Collection", "Databases, Factual", "Demography", "Drug Utilization", "Female", "Humans", "Infant", "Infant, Newborn", "Intraoperative Complications", "Lower Extremity", "Male", "Nerve Block", "Postoperative Complications", "Prospective Studies", "Thorax", "United States", "Upper Extremity"]}

A single-institution, prospective study of 40 consecutive patients undergoing Nuss bar placement for pectus excavatum between November 2019 and January 2021 was conducted to assess the effectiveness of a multimodality pain management protocol. All patients received T3-T8 intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC), T3-T8 bupivacaine intercostal nerve blocks, Exparel at the skin incisions, and management with a perioperative analgesia regimen that minimized narcotic usage. The primary outcome was LOS. Secondary outcomes included opioid use, pain scores, and time to sensory recovery. 37/40 patients (92.5%) were discharged home on postoperative day (POD) 1, and 3/40 (7.5%) were discharged on POD 2 (mean LOS = 1.1 days). The median average postoperative pain score was 2/10. After eliminating IVPCA from our protocol, total oral morphine equivalent (OME) decreased by 73% (55.5 mg to 15 mg) with no change in pain scores or discharge timing. INC combined with bupivacaine intercostal nerve blocks and a pre- and post-hospital analgesia protocol facilitated discharge one day after the Nuss procedure, achieved excellent pain control, and eliminated the need for intravenous opioids.

The author developed the crane technique in 2002 and successfully applied it to more than 2,000 cases using sternal wire stitching. However, blind sternal suturing limited the use of the wire-stitch crane. We propose a novel screw for sternal lifting as a new tool for the crane technique. We developed a screw system strong enough to withstand the pressure needed for sternum lifting. The screw was designed to have a broader thread to hold the bony tissue securely. The screw's sustaining power was tested using the torsion, driving torque, and axial pull-out tests in a polyurethane block and ex-vivo porcine sternum. The screws were easily driven into the sternum, and the head of the screw was connectable to the table-mounted retractor. In the torsion test, the 2° offset torsional yield was 4.53 N·m (reference value, 1 N·m). In the polyurethane block driving torque test, the maximum torque was 0.98 N·m (reference value, 0.70 N·m). The axial pull-out test was 446 N (reference value, 100 N). The maximum pull-out resistance in the ex-vivo porcine sternum model was 1,516 N. The screw crane was strong enough to sustain the chest wall weight to be lifted. Thus, the screws could effectively replace the sternal wire stitching in crane pre-lifting of the sternum. We expect that application of the screw-crane will be easy and that it will improve the safety and success rate of pectus repair surgery.", "mesh": []}

Early Recovery Program (ERP) protocols for the Nuss procedure are becoming common, but there is a paucity of experience using liposomal bupivacaine (LB), a long-acting local anesthetic, for rib blocks in this setting. We investigated whether a protocol utilizing LB rib blocks decreased opioid use after the Nuss procedure while achieving equivalent pain control. All adolescent patients undergoing the Nuss procedure at our institution between January 2013 and January 2021 were included. Patients were divided into a pre-intervention cohort (n=15), a transition cohort (n=4), and a post-intervention cohort (n=13). Patients in all groups received scheduled acetaminophen and non-steroidals postoperatively. The pre-intervention cohort received an opioid patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump postoperatively, with a transition to oral opiates. The transition and post-intervention cohorts received scheduled gabapentin in addition to intraoperative bilateral rib blocks with longer-acting local anesthetic. Rib blocks were performed using 0.25% Bupivacaine in the pre-intervention group. In the transition group, epinephrine (1 mg/kg) was added to 0.25% bupivacaine for the rib block. Following approval in patients aged 13-18 years, 1.3% LB (2.25 mg/kg) was given for a rib block in the post-intervention cohort. Demographic and clinical variables were equivalent in all groups. Post-intervention patients received 90% fewer opioids [median morphine equivalent (MME) mg/kg] compared to the pre-intervention cohort (0.8 vs. 8.2 MME mg/kg, P<0.0001), with no significant difference in pain scores between groups. Hospital length of stay was decreased among the intervention cohort (3 vs. 4 days, P=0.002). Significant decreases in opioid use and length of stay after the Nuss procedure were achieved by the implementation of a multimodal ERP for pain management, without increase in patient-reported pain scores. 2021 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

We hypothesize that cryoablation is associated with decreased post-thoracotomy pain and opioid use in pediatric oncology patients. A single-center retrospective cohort study was performed for oncology patients who underwent thoracotomy from January 1, 2017 to May 31, 2021. Outcomes included postoperative opioid use measured in morphine milligram equivalents per kilogram (MME/kg), pain scores (scale 0-10), and opioid prescription at discharge. Univariable analysis compared patients who received cryoablation to patients who did not receive cryoablation. Multivariable regression analysis controlling for age and prior thoracotomy evaluated associations between cryoablation and postoperative pain. Overall, 32 patients (19 males:13 females) underwent thoracotomy with 16 who underwent >1 thoracotomy resulting in 53 thoracotomies included for analysis. Cryoablation was used in 14 of 53 (26.4%) thoracotomies. Throughout the postoperative hospitalization, patients receiving cryoablation during thoracotomy consumed less opioids compared to patients who did not receive cryoablation (median 0.38 MME/kg, interquartile range [IQR] 0.20-1.15 versus median 1.47 MME/kg, IQR 0.71-4.02, P < 0.01). Maximum pain scores were lower in cryoablation patients (median 6, IQR 5-8) than noncryoablation patients (median 8, IQR 6-10), with a significant difference observed on postoperative day 4 (P = 0.01). Cryoablation patients were also less frequently prescribed opioids at discharge (21.4% versus 58.97%, P = 0.02).

A retrospective review was conducted at a single center from May 2023 to January 2024 among patients <21 years who underwent MIPRE-C. Demographic and clinical data, including inpatient and outpatient opioid use were reviewed. Patients completed opioid use questionnaires at their first postoperative visit. Simple linear regression was employed to create a model for outpatient opioid use. Sixty-eight patients underwent MIRPE-C: 84% were male (mean age of 15.2 ± 1.7 years, and median Haller index 4.2[IQR:3.7-5.7]). Daily mean inpatient opioid requirement and daily opioid doses were 0.3 ± 0.2 OME/day/kg and 2 ± 1.2 opioid doses/day. At the first outpatient follow-up visit, patients reported using a median of five 5-mg oxycodone tablets [IQR:1.6-10] for 5 days [IQR:2-7] with 22% of patients needing an opioid refill. On linear regression, inpatient opioid use had a significant relationship with the number of outpatient doses taken, while patient factors were not associated with outpatient opioid use. A simple equation for predicting opioid need based on best fit (R2 = 0.211) was developed: #OUTPATIENT OPIOID TABLETS = 3 TABLETS + (0.82 x #INPATIENT OPIOID RECIEVED). The proposed outpatient opioid prescription model is simple to calculate and tailors the prescription to individual patient need. This model has the potential to provide effective pain control and avoid prescription refills, while minimizing over-prescription of opioids. Treatment study Level III. Copyright © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

With the high incidence of chronic pain in thoracic surgery patients and adverse effects of opioids, we examined the safety and efficacy of cryoneurolysis as an adjunct for narcotic-free pain management in robotic-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomies. Ten consecutive patients undergoing robotic-assisted (DaVinci) pulmonary resection and cryoneurolysis were compared to ten patients managed without intraoperative cryoneurolysis. All patients received multimodal pain regimen including paravertebral blocks as per our institutional enhanced recovery pathway. Patients with chronic pain and chronic opioid use were excluded. We compared inpatient and outpatient opioid consumption measured in morphine equivalents (mme), incidence of opioid-free outpatient recovery, and adverse events. The two groups did not differ significantly in terms of baseline demographics. Both inpatient (88.13 vs 26.92 mme) and outpatient (118.5 vs 34.5 mme) use of narcotics were significantly lower in the cryoneurolysis group (p < 0.05) with seven of ten patients receiving cryoneurolysis able to recover without the use of opioids in the outpatient setting, compared to two in the control group.

Pectus carinatum and combined manifestations of chest wall deformities can also lead to physiological and psychosocial impairment and require treatment tailored to the individual patient in such cases. Syndromal chest wall deformities, such as Jeune syndrome, comprise a separate group of rare diseases that are associated with considerable, occasionally life-threatening comorbidities. These patients should be cared for in centres with appropriate expertise in an interdisciplinary and multimodal manner.

Our institution developed protocols to standardize pain management for pectus excavatum patients in the immediate postoperative period. We present our experience with protocol implementation and patient outcomes. We standardized regional anesthesia with a 0.25% bupivacaine incisional soaker catheter (post-implementation 1, PI1) before transitioning to intercostal nerve cryoablation (INC) (post-implementation 2, PI2). Patient outcomes were tracked using statistical process control charts in AdaptX™ OR Advisor and run charts in Tableau. Chi-squared tests assessed demographic differences between cohorts. 244 patients were included: 78 pre-implementation, 108 PI1, and 58 PI2. Average age was 15.9-16.5 years. Patients were majority male, non-Hispanic white, and English speaking. Hospital length of stay decreased 4.1-2.4 days. INC increased surgery time (99-125 min) but decreased PACU time (112-78 min). Maximum pain scores improved in PACU (7.7-6.0) and 0-24 h postoperatively (8.3-6.8) but were not different 24-48 h postoperatively (5.4-5.8). Average opioid dosing decreased 0-48 h from 1.9 to 0.8 mg/kg morphine milliequivalents and was associated with reduction in post-operative nausea and constipation. There were no 30-day readmissions. An institution-wide pain management protocol using INC for pectus excavatum patients was implemented. Intercostal nerve cryoablation was found to be superior to bupivacaine incisional soaker catheters and reduced hospital length of stay, immediate postoperative pain scores, morphine milliequivalent opioid dosing, postoperative nausea, and constipation.

Small studies show that intraoperative intercostal nerve cryoablation provides effective analgesia with no large-scale evaluations of this technique. The pediatric health information system database was used to perform a retrospective cohort study comparing patients undergoing MIRPE at children's hospitals before and after the initiation of cryoablation. The association of cryoablation use with inpatient opioid use was determined using quantile regression with robust standard errors. Difference in risk-adjusted length of stay between the cohorts was estimated using negative binomial regression. Odds of adverse events between the two cohorts were compared using logistic regression with a generalized estimating equation. A total of 5442 patients underwent MIRPE at 44 children's hospitals between 2016 and 2022 with 1592 patients treated after cryoablation was introduced at their hospital. Cryoablation use was associated with a median decrease of 80.8 (95% CI: 68.6-93.0) total oral morphine equivalents as well as a decrease in estimated median length of stay from 3.5 [3.2-3.9] days to 2.5 [2.2-2.9] days ( P value: 0.016). Cryoablation use was not significantly associated with an increase in any studied adverse events. Introduction of cryoablation for perioperative analgesia was associated with decreased inpatient opioid use and length of stay in a large sample with no change in adverse events.

{"pmid": 36350702, "title": "Intercostal Nerve Cryoablation in Minimally Invasive Repair of Pectus Excavatum: Effect on Pulmonary Function.", "abstract": "Introduction: Cryoablation of intercostal nerves is performed for pain control after minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE). Cryoablation affects both sensory and motor neurons, resulting in temporary anesthesia to the chest wall and loss of intercostal motor function. The study objective is to determine the effect of cryoablation on incentive spirometry (IS) volumes, as a measure of pulmonary function, after MIRPE. Materials and Methods: A single-institution retrospective review of pediatric patients undergoing MIRPE was performed. All patients received a multimodal regimen (MMR) of analgesics postoperatively. Three groups were compared-cryoablation (CRYO), elastomeric pain pump (EPP), and MMR alone. The primary outcomes were postoperative IS volumes and IS volumes as a ratio of preoperative forced vital capacity (FVC). Secondary outcomes included pain scores, opioid use, length of stay (LOS), and infectious complications. Results: MIRPE was performed in 115 patients: 50 CRYO, 50 EPP, and 15 MMR alone. Groups were similar for demographics and pectus excavatum severity. Postoperative spirometry measurements were similar across groups: IS (CRYO 750 mL [500,961] versus EPP 750 mL [590,1019] versus MMR 696 mL [500,1037], P = .77); IS/FVC (CRYO 0.19 [0.14,0.26] versus EPP 0.20 [0.16,0.26] versus MMR 0.16 [0.15,0.24], P = .69). Although pain scores were also similar across groups, CRYO patients used less opioid (P < .05) and had shorter LOS (P < .05). Postoperative pneumonia was rare and similar across groups (P = 1.00). Conclusion: Intercostal nerve cryoablation during MIRPE does not adversely affect postoperative IS volumes or increase pneumonia rate, despite the temporary loss of motor innervation to intercostal muscles. Cryoablation provides effective pain control with less opioid use.", "mesh": ["Humans", "Child", "Intercostal Nerves", "Analgesics, Opioid", "Pain, Postoperative", "Funnel Chest", "Cryosurgery", "Retrospective Studies", "Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures"]}

The most recently published National Readmissions Database (2016-2020) was queried for patient aged 12-21 years old who underwent Nuss Procedure for pectus excavatum. Patient demographics, hospital factors, and patient outcomes including hospital length of stay, opioid-related complications, readmission, post-operative acute pain, respiratory complications, post-operative bleeding, chest tube insertion, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, and hospital costs were analyzed. 818 patients were analyzed in this study. 62 % received epidural/regional analgesia and 38 % received intercostal nerve cryoablation. The mean age in the cohort was 16 ± 2 years old. 86 % of the study cohort was male. Intercostal nerve cryoablation was associated with significantly reduced opioid-related complications (4.3 % vs 8.7 %, p = 0.015), hospital length of stay (2 [2-3] vs 4 [3-5] days, p < 0.001), and respiratory failure when compared to epidural analgesia.

Multi-modal pain management protocols are increasingly used, but there is limited experience using transdermal lidocaine patches (TLP) in this patient population. Pediatric anesthesiologists and surgeons in a children's hospital within a hospital designed a multi-modal perioperative pain management protocol for patients undergoing Nuss repair of PE (IRB00068901). The protocol included use of TLP in addition to other adjuncts such as methadone, gabapentin, and NSAIDS. Following initiation of the protocol charts were reviewed retrospectively, comparing outcomes before and after implementation of the protocol. Forty-nine patients underwent a Nuss procedure between 2013 and 2022, 15 prior to initiation of the protocol and 34 after. Patient demographics and operative length were similar between the two groups. Average length of stay decreased from 4.7 to 3.3 days and reported opioid use at the time of the first outpatient post-op visit dropped from 60% to 24% (p < 0.05).

We tested the hypothesis that a single-injection thoracic paravertebral block, performed preoperatively, reduces pain scores after thoracoscopic surgery. Of 45 patients recruited, 40 completed the study. They were randomly allocated to two groups: the paravertebral group received i.v. patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine plus single-injection thoracic paravertebral block with bupivacaine 0.375% and adrenaline 1:200 000 0.4 ml kg(-1) (n=20).

The main outcomes recorded during 48 h after surgery were pain scores using the visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-100). Secondary outcomes were cumulative morphine consumption and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR). Half an hour and 24 h after surgery, median (25th-75th percentiles) VAS on coughing in the paravertebral group was 31.0 (20.0-55.0) and 30.5 (17.5-40.0) respectively and in the control group it was 70.0 (30.0-100.0) and 50.0 (25.0-75.0) respectively.

Mechanisms of bar displacement have been elucidated by case-by-case analysis, and specific bar fixation techniques have been developed to deal with each mechanism. The efficacy of our bar fixation techniques is appraised. Data from 725 consecutive patients between 1999 and 2006 who were repaired with our modifications to the Nuss procedure were retrospectively analyzed. The mechanism of bar displacement consisted of one or a combination of the following types: type 1, \"bar flipping\"--rotation of the bar along the axis of hinge; type 2, \"lateral sliding\"--horizontal slipping of the bar to one side in asymmetric pectus excavatum; and type 3, \"hinge-point disruption\"--a dorsal shift of the bar owing to tearing of the supporting intercostal musculature. Specific bar fixation techniques have been tailored to compensate for potential mechanisms of bar displacement according to pectus morphology: multipoint pericostal bar fixation (MPF) (n = 496) for type 1 displacement; incorporation of a stabilizer on the depressed side (n = 169) for type 2 displacement; and hinge point reinforcement and the crane technique (n = 122) for type 3 displacement. The bar displacement rate was decreased with our mechanism-based approach (4.6% before MPF vs 1.8% after MPF, P = .045). In addition, the major complication rates (6.8% before MPF vs 2.0% after MPF, P = .001) and reoperation rates (5.5% before MPF vs 1.6% after MPF, P = .019) decreased.

Multivariate analysis was performed to control for introduction of intercostal nerve cryoablation and surgeon volume, and reported as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. Two hundred and sixty-five patients were identified. Patients repaired with two bars were older with a larger Haller index (HI). Patient demographics were not significantly different for SE or stabilizing suture use. Placement of two bars was associated with significantly increased risk of readmission. Similarly, SE use was associated with increased risk of pleural effusion and readmission. Finally, the use of bilateral stabilizing sutures resulted in less frequent slipped bars without statistical significance. Older patients with a larger HI were more likely to need two bars placed to repair pectus excavatum. Placement of multiple bars and SE use are associated with significantly higher odds of certain complications. Thieme.

We thus assessed the time-dependence of catheter-related infection risk up to 15 days. Our analysis was based on the German Network for Regional Anesthesia, which includes 25 centers. We considered 44,555 patients who had surgery between 2007 and 2014 and had continuous regional anesthesia as well as complete covariable details. Cox regression analysis was performed and adjusted for confounding covariables to examine the relationship between catheter duration and probability of infection-free catheter use. After adjustment for confounding factors, the probability of infection-free catheter use decreases with each day of peripheral and epidural catheter use. In peripheral catheters, it was 99% at day 4 of catheter duration, 96% at day 7, and 73% at day 15. In epidural catheters, it was 99% at day 4 of catheter duration, 95% at day 7, and 73% at day 15. Only 31 patients (0.07%) had severe infections that prompted surgical intervention. Among these were five catheters that initially had only mild or moderate signs of infection and were left in situ; all progressed to severe infections. Infection risk in catheter use increases over time, especially after four days. Infected catheters should be removed as soon as practical.

Their demographic data and pharmacoepidemiological characteristics of opioid consumption and opioid prescriptions issued in ambulatory visits were analyzed. In total, 159 patients were enrolled as COT-requiring CNCP patients, and the prevalence was calculated at 0.016% in a 2-year period. Females were outnumbered by males (45.3% vs. 54.7%). Almost 60% of them were of working age and 93.7% belonged to low-income households, as in the health insurance claims, probably implying socioeconomic disadvantages associated with CNCP. The leading three diagnoses were unspecified myalgia and myositis, lumbago, and abdominal pain of unspecified site. The most common department from where these 159 CNCP patients obtained their opioid prescriptions was the emergency department (27.6%), ensued by a pain clinic (25.3%), but they could acquire only a few opioid therapeutic days through emergency department visits. Moreover, pain clinic satisfied the majority of opioid therapeutic days. Among all opioids, morphine was the most frequently prescribed in opioid-obtaining ambulatory visits, accounting for most of the opioid therapeutic days as well as opioid consumption. COT-requiring CNCP patients were easily associated with adverse socioeconomic liabilities and often visited emergency department as well as pain clinics. Morphine was the main opioid used for their chronic pain. Transfer of COT-requiring CNCP patients to appropriate departments is strongly recommended for efficient long-term pharmacotherapy for their chronic pain. Copyright © 2015.

Surgeons therefore developed techniques that corrected the deformity using an open procedure via the anterior chest wall. Initial techniques were unsatisfactory, but by the 1930s the partial rib resection and sternal osteotomy technique had been developed and was used in combination with external traction post-operatively to prevent the sternum from sinking back into the chest. In 1949, Ravitch recommended complete resection of the costal cartilages and complete mobilization of the sternum without external traction, and in 1961 Adkins and Blades introduced the concept of a substernal strut for sternal support. The wide resection resulted in a very rigid anterior chest wall, and in some instances, the development of asphyxiating chondrodystrophy. The primary care physicians therefore became reluctant to refer the patients for repair. In 1987, Nuss developed a minimally invasive technique that required no cartilage or sternal resection and relied only on internal bracing by means of a sub-sternal bar, which is inserted into the chest through two lateral thoracic incisions and guided across the mediastinum with the help of thoracoscopy. After publication of the procedure in 1998, it became widely accepted and a flood of new patients suddenly started to appear, which allowed for rapid improvements and modifications of the technique. New instruments were developed specifically for the procedure, complications were recognized, and the steps taken to prevent them included the development of a stabilizer and the use of pericostal sutures to prevent bar displacement. Various options were developed for sternal elevation prior to mediastinal dissection to prevent injury to the mediastinal structures, allergy testing was implemented, and pain management improved. The increased number of patients coming for repair permitted studies of cardiopulmonary function, which showed that patients with a severe degree of pectus excavatum have right- sided cardiac compression, decreased filling, and decreased stroke volume. The degree of pulmonary restriction and obstruction is related to the degree of deformity and degree of cardiac displacement into the left chest. The indications for surgical repair have been clearly outlined, the procedure has been standardized, and post-operative management protocols are now available. A review of our prospective database showed that 98% of patients have a good to excellent outcome. This review of the \"Past\" outlines the progression of the surgical techniques during the 20th century, the review of the \"Present\" outlines the important modifications and results of the closed technique, and the review of the \"Future\" outlines the various new options that are becoming available for the treatment of pectus excavatum.", "mesh": []}

The sandwich 1 and 2 techniques using the internal and external pectus bars were for pectus carinatum repair. Modified techniques using the external string and the internal bar were to treat the lower costal flare (the flare-buster) and focal protuberances (the magic string) in pectus excavatum repair. Statistical analyses were carried out using paired and unpaired t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank tests.

Repair requires surgery. The less invasive Nuss procedure is very successful, but postoperative pain management is challenging and evolving. New pain management techniques to reduce opioid reliance include the erector spinae plane (ESP) block. We retrospectively examined opioid consumption after Nuss procedure comparing three pain management techniques: ESP block, thoracic epidural (TE), and patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). This retrospective cohort study compared pain management outcomes of three patient groups. Seventy-eight subjects aged 10-18 years underwent Nuss procedure at our institution between January 2014 and January 2020. The primary outcome measure was opioid consumption measured in morphine milligram equivalents. Secondary measures included pain ratings and length of stay (LOS). Pain was quantified using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale. Analysis of variance was performed on all outcome measures. Average cumulative opioid use was significantly lower in the ESP block (67 mg) than the TE (117 mg) (p=0.0002) or the PCA group (172 mg) (p=0.0002). The ESP block and PCA groups both had a significantly shorter average LOS (3.3 and 3.7 days, respectively) than the TE group (4.7 days). ESP block performed best for reducing opioid consumption and LOS. Reduced opioid consumption is key for limiting side effects. This study supports use of ESP block as a superior choice when choosing among the three postoperative pain management options that were evaluated. ESP resulted in reduced opioid consumption postoperatively and shorter LOS than TE or PCA for patients undergoing the Nuss procedure for surgical repair of pectus excavatum. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022.

Thus far, genetic studies support an autosomal recessive heritability, which coincides with only 40% of our patients having some positive family history, but is also contradictory given a constant sex ratio of 4:1 in favor of males. This inconsistency may be explained by the effect of more than one pectus disease-associated allele. Once the deformity is noticed, it tends to progress slowly until puberty, when rapid progression is often seen. We recommend surgical repair at around 12-14 years of age since the chest wall is still typically flexible and because this allows us to keep the bar in place as the patient progresses through puberty which may help decrease growth-related recurrences. Patients with mild to moderate PE are treated with therapeutic deep breathing, posturing, and aerobic exercises, and in appropriately selected patients, the vacuum bell may also be offered. Patients that have severe symptomatic PE are offered Minimally Invasive Repair of Pectus Excavatum (MIRPE). The surgical technique in children is similar to that of adults, except for the higher forces involved that often necessitate sternal elevation and more involved stabilization strategies.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a single center for PE patients who underwent the Nuss procedure from 2017 to 2022. Outcomes included postoperative opioid use (measured in oral morphine milligram equivalent per kilogram [OME/kg]), average pain score (scale 0-10), and length of stay (LOS). One hundred sixty-four patients (146 males and 18 females) were included, with 79 (48.2%) receiving neither cryoablation nor nerve block, 60 (36.6%) receiving intraoperative cryoablation alone, and 25 (15.2%) receiving both cryoablation and nerve block. The median age was 16 y. Nerve block recipients consumed fewer opioids during hospitalization than cryoablation alone and nonintervention groups (1.5 versus 2.3 versus 5.8 OME/kg, respectively, P < 0.0001). Average pain scores over the total LOS were lower in nerve block recipients (3.5 versus 3.8 versus 4.2, P = 0.03), particularly on postoperative day 0 (P = 0.002). Nerve block recipients had a shorter LOS than cryoablation alone and nonintervention groups (43.4 versus 54.7 versus 66.2 h, P < 0.0001). On multivariate analysis, cryoablation alone resulted in significantly less opioid use compared to no intervention (3.32 OME/kg reduction, 95% confidence interval -4.16 to -2.47, P < 0.0001). Addition of nerve block further reduced opioid use by 1.10 OME/kg (95% confidence interval -2.07 to -0.14, P = 0.04). Cryoablation with nerve block supplementation is associated with reduced pain, opioid use, and LOS post-Nuss for PE repair compared to cases without cryoablation or with cryoablation only.

However, its benefit have never been demonstrated in minimal invasive thoracotomy heart valve surgery (Mini-HVS). The purpose of the study was to determine whether intraoperative intercostal cryo nerve block in conjunction with standard of care (collectively referred to hereafter as CryoNB) provided superior analgesic efficacy in patients undergoing Mini-HVS compared to standard-of-care (SOC). FROST was a prospective, 3:1 randomized (CryoNB vs. SOC), multicenter trial in patients undergoing Mini-HVS. The primary endpoint was the 48-h postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) result. Secondary endpoints were visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain at the surgical site and general pain, intensive care unit and hospital length-of-stay, total opioid consumption, and allodynia at 6 months postoperatively. A total of 84 patients were randomized to the two arms of the trial CryoNB (n = 65) and SOC (n = 19). Baseline Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predictive Risk of Mortality (STS PROM) score, ejection fraction, and FEV1 were similar between cohorts. A higher 48-h postoperative FEV1 result was demonstrated in the CryoNB cohort versus the SOC cohort (1.20 ± 0.46 vs. 0.93 ± 0.43 L; P = 0.02, one-sided two-sample t test). Surgical site VAS scores were similar between the CryoNB and SOC cohorts at all postoperative timepoints evaluated, but VAS scores not related to the surgical site were lower in the SOC group at 72, 94, and 120 h postoperatively. The SOC cohort had a 13% higher opioid consumption than the CryoNB cohort. One of 64 CryoNB patients reported allodynia that did not require pain medication at 10 months. The results of FROST demonstrated that intercostal CryoNB provided enhanced FEV1 score at 48 h postoperatively with optimized analgesic effectiveness versus SOC. Future larger prospective randomized trials are warranted to determine whether intercostal CryoNB has an opioid-sparing effect in patients undergoing Mini-HVS.

Commonly employed analgesic strategies do not completely solve this issue and have their own drawbacks. Cryoablation of intercostal nerves has been proposed as an appealing alternative to address the postoperative pain. Between 2020 and 2021, data of all consecutive patients undergoing TAA or TAAA aortic aneurysms open repair with electroneurography-guided cryoablation of intercostal nerves were collected. Postoperative pain was recorded using patient-reported 0-10 numeric rating scale (NRS). Need for adjunctive opioid drugs and postoperative complications were also recorded. Narcotic usage was calculated as morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) per day. A total of 15 patients (8 males, mean age 61.1-year-old) underwent open surgical repair for TAAA (13 cases) or TAA (2 cases) and received intercostal nerve cryoablation. There were no intraoperative deaths and cases of spinal cord ischemia. Overall, 70 intercostal nerves underwent electroneurography-guided cryoablation, with a mean of 4.6 nerves per patient. On the first day after extubating, mean NRS was 4.6 and the MMEs calculated was 6.7, decreasing over the days. There was one case of pneumonia and atelectasis requiring bronchoscopy. There were no reported bowel complications. The mean postoperative length of stay was 16 days and in the intensive care unit stay was 6.5 days. Electroneurography-guided cryoablation of intercostal nerves is a safe and reproducible technique which can be used in addition to systemic pain management for TAA and TAAA open repair.", "mesh": ["Aortic Aneurysm, Thoracic", "Cryosurgery", "Humans", "Intercostal Nerves", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pain Management", "Pain, Postoperative", "Retrospective Studies", "Treatment Outcome"]}

Recently, intercostal nerve cryoablation has been introduced as a pain management technique. In this cohort study, we compared the efficacy of multimodal pain management strategies in children undergoing a Nuss procedure. The effectiveness of intercostal nerve cryoablation combined with patient-controlled systemic opioid analgesia (PCA) was compared with continuous epidural analgesia (CEA) combined with PCA. The study was conducted between January 2019 and July 2022. Primary outcome was length of stay (LOS), and secondary outcomes were operation room time, postoperative pain, opioid consumption, and gabapentin use. Sixty-six consecutive patients were included, 33 patients in each group. The cryoablation group exhibited lower Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores on postoperative day 1 and 2 (p = 0.002, p = 0.001) and a shorter LOS (3 vs. 6 days (p < 0.001). Cryoablation resulted in less patients requiring opioids at discharge (30.3 vs. 97.0%; p < 0.001) and 1 week after surgery (6.1 vs. 45.4%; p < 0.001)). In the CEA group, gabapentin use was more prevalent (78.8 vs. 18.2%; p < 0.001) and the operation room time was shorter (119.4 vs. 135.0 minutes; p < .010). No neuropathic pain was reported. Intercostal nerve cryoablation is a superior analgesic method compared with CEA, with reduced LOS, opioid use, and NRS pain scores. The prophylactic use of gabapentin is redundant. The Author(s).

This study evaluated the relationship between cryoablation and clinical outcomes for the Nuss procedure. A retrospective single-center chart review was performed on patients undergoing the Nuss procedure with intercostal cryoablation from December 2017-August 2021. Demographics, hospital course, and postoperative complications were abstracted. To evaluate the evolution of outcomes over time, the earliest quarter (Q1) of cryoablation patients was compared to the last quarter (Q4). Over 45 months, 350 Nuss procedures with cryoablation were performed. The mean age at operation was 15.7 ± 2.3 years with an average Haller Index of 5.4 ± 4.2. The mean operative time was 136 ± 40.5 minutes. On average, patients used 2.8 ± 2.5 OME/kg of opioid in hospital with a LOS of 2.7 ± 1.1 days. The Q4 patients were discharged 1.3 days earlier (p<0.05) than Q1 patients, with 80% of Q4 discharged by postoperative day #2 vs. 23% in Q1 (p<0.05). Q4 patients received 74% (p<0.05) less opioid in hospital and 21% (p<0.05) less on discharge. Within 90 days postoperatively, complication rates (chest tube placement, wound infection, readmission, neuropathic pain) were similar. Only two patients (0.6%) required reoperation for bar migration/slippage. With increased experience, cryoablation for the Nuss procedure decreased opioid use by 74% and was associated with 80% of patients achieving early discharge. Major complication rates were not increased. Cryoablation can be successfully implemented as an effective method of postoperative analgesia. Level III. Copyright © 2022.

Adequate postoperative pain therapy is important far beyond the immediate postoperative period because sensitization to painful stimuli can cause chronic pain or higher pain levels during subsequent surgical procedures. Although data in adults favor thoracic epidural anesthesia for pain control in thoracotomy, data for adolescents and children are scarce. We tested the hypothesis that pain relief with thoracic epidural analgesia was superior to that with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia after minimally invasive pectus excavatum repair in children and adolescents. We performed a prospective randomized trial with adolescents who had undergone minimally invasive pectus excavatum repair to compare postoperative pain using two different postoperative pain therapy settings: intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (n = 20) with morphine versus continuous thoracic epidural analgesia (n = 20) with 0.2% ropivacain containing 2 microg/mL fentanyl. Forty patients (32 male and 8 female patients) aged 10 to 28 years were studied. The thoracic epidural analgesia group showed lower pain scores (P < .0001) and required less additional pain medication in conjunction with greater well-being postoperatively (P < .0001) compared with patients receiving patient-controlled intravenous morphine. There was no significant difference regarding the incidence of sedation (P = .38), nausea (P = .10), and pruritus (P = .72) in both groups.

We sought to examine the effects of MIRPE on exercise response during cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). A prospective-pilot study was conduct of patients ≤18 years who presented for pectus bar removal. All patients had CPET prior to MIRPE and following bar removal. Paired sample T tests were used to compare pre- and post-MIRPE CPET results. Twenty-five patients completed post-MIRPE CPET (72 % male, median age 18.6 [IQR:17.5-19.8]). The median Haller and correction indices were 4.5 and 29.4 %, respectively. There was significant increase in O2Pulse, (10.3 vs 12.1 mL/beat, p = 0.004), and percent predicted O2Pulse (79.5% vs 84.4 %, p = 0.046) following MIRPE/bar removal. The peak-VO2/kg and did not change significantly following MIRPE/bar removal; however, peak-VO2 (ml/min) increased. Patients with decreased activity levels at time of bar removal compared to pre-MIRPE had decreased peak-VO2/kg and predicted peak-VO2/kg. Following MIRPE, patients experience increased in O2Pulse, which is a surrogate measure of stroke volume response to exercise and may reflect relief of cardiac compression. Cardiopulmonary function is multifactorial and despite improvement in stroke volume, other factors may impact exercise capacity (VO2) following MIRPE. Treatment Study. IV.

The question addressed was whether incentive spirometry is a useful intervention for patients after thoracic surgery. Altogether 255 papers were found using the reported search, of which seven represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. We conclude that incentive spirometry is a relatively good measure of lung function and may be used to assess respiratory recovery in the days after thoracic surgery. Physiotherapy either with or without incentive spirometry reduces the incidence of postoperative complications and improves lung function but there is currently no evidence that incentive spirometry in itself could either replace or significantly augment the work of the physiotherapists. Clinicians should be aware that while incentive spirometry can provide an assessment of lung recovery, well-organised and regular physiotherapy remains the most effective mechanism to augment their patient's recovery and avoid postoperative complications.", "mesh": ["Aged", "Benchmarking", "Evidence-Based Medicine", "Humans", "Lung", "Lung Diseases", "Male", "Physical Therapy Modalities", "Pneumonectomy", "Practice Guidelines as Topic", "Spirometry", "Treatment Outcome"]}

Multimodal pain management with regional anesthesia, particularly by delivery of local anesthetics using a paravertebral catheter (PVC), has been shown to reduce pain in operations involving thoracotomy incisions. However, few studies have reported high-quality safety and efficacy outcomes of PVCs following MICS. Patients who underwent MICS at Vancouver General Hospital between 2016 and 2019 (N = 123) were reviewed for perioperative opioid-narcotic use. Primary outcomes were postoperative opioid use and hospital length of stay (LOS). Statistical analyses were performed using univariate and multivariable regression models to determine independent risk factors. A total of 54 patients received routine systemic analgesia (control), 53 patients received a paravertebral catheter (PVC), and 16 patients received another mode of regional analgesia (non-PVC). The mean hospital LOS was significantly different in patients in the PVC group at 5.8 ± 2.0 days versus 8.3 ± 7.1 days in the control and 6.6 ± 2.3 days in the non-PVC group (P = 0.033). The percentage of patients who did not require postoperative oxycodone was significantly higher in the PVC group (48.1%), compared with the control (24.5%) and non-PVC (37.5%; P = 0.043) groups. The administration of regional anesthesia using PVCs was associated with reduced need for opioids and a shorter LOS. The reduction in postoperative opioids may reduce the risk of potential opioid dependency in this population.

The goal of our study was to evaluate whether narcotics consumption is consistently lower after VATS for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as compared to open surgery, during one-year follow-up. This nationwide retrospective cohort study was conducted using data relating to cancer registry and national compulsory comprehensive claims in Taiwan. Our study cases were those newly diagnosed with clinical Stage I NSCLC, who underwent primary lung resection in the year 2007. The date of the admission during which index surgery was performed was used as the index date. We compared the use of narcotics, between the VATS and open surgery groups, over a period of one year following the index date. We defined narcotics as either Level 1 or 2 drugs as regulated in Taiwan. We also used an equiananalgesic dose chart to convert drug consumption into a uniform narcotics equivalent dose. Chi-square and t-tests were used for statistical analysis. We identified 329 cases (114 for VATS and 215 for open surgery). These two groups were balanced for most clinical variables. VATS was associated with lower narcotics consumption during the index admission (mean equivalent dose of intravenous morphine: 54.6 vs 71.4 mg) and this trend extended to the period covering the 2nd to 12th month after index date (73.8 vs 149.5mg).

Demographic data included age, weight, sex, and anesthesia/surgical times. Treatment days (defined as the number of days the patients received intravenous or epidural analgesia), time to oral intake, and time to discharge from the hospital were also recorded. Pain scores using a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain) and sedation scores were recorded in the postanesthesia care unit and at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hours postoperatively.

Analgesic outcomes remained similar between the cohorts after adjustment for pertinent patient and analgesic characteristics (P = 0.26), as well as after exclusion of Cryo patients requiring rescue TEA (P = 0.32). There were no Cryo complications, with four patients requiring subsequent TEA for pain control. Two TEA patients experienced hemodynamic instability following a test TEA bolus requiring code measures. Additionally, TEA placement was delayed beyond postoperative day 1 in 33% owing to need for anticoagulation or clinical instability.

Differences between treatment groups were assessed using gamma distribution (HDs and HCs) and poisson (post-operative complications). All models used log link and controlled for age, gender, race, and Haller index. Forty-four patients underwent MIRPE during the study period. Cryoanalgesia was utilized in 29 (66%) patients. The probability of a reduction with cryoanalgesia vs. no cryoanalgesia was 99% for HDs (3.0 vs. 5.4 days; Bayesian RR: 0.6, 95% CrI: 0.5-0.8), 89% for HCs ($18,787 vs. $19,667; RR: 0.9, 95% CrI: 0.8-1.1), and 70% for postoperative complications (17% vs 33%; RR: 0.8, 95% CrI: 0.3-1.9). Cryoanalgesia use in MIRPE likely reduced HDs, HCs, and post-operative complications. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings in large prospective studies. Level III.

Filtering of searches is time consuming, and no single method fulfills the principal requirements of speed with accuracy. Automation of systematic reviews is driven by a necessity to expedite the availability of current best evidence for policy and clinical decision-making. We developed Rayyan ( http://rayyan.qcri.org ), a free web and mobile app, that helps expedite the initial screening of abstracts and titles using a process of semi-automation while incorporating a high level of usability. For the beta testing phase, we used two published Cochrane reviews in which included studies had been selected manually. Their searches, with 1030 records and 273 records, were uploaded to Rayyan. Different features of Rayyan were tested using these two reviews. We also conducted a survey of Rayyan's users and collected feedback through a built-in feature. Pilot testing of Rayyan focused on usability, accuracy against manual methods, and the added value of the prediction feature. The \"taster\" review (273 records) allowed a quick overview of Rayyan for early comments on usability. The second review (1030 records) required several iterations to identify the previously identified 11 trials. The \"suggestions\" and \"hints,\" based on the \"prediction model,\" appeared as testing progressed beyond five included studies. Post rollout user experiences and a reflexive response by the developers enabled real-time modifications and improvements. The survey respondents reported 40% average time savings when using Rayyan compared to others tools, with 34% of the respondents reporting more than 50% time savings. In addition, around 75% of the respondents mentioned that screening and labeling studies as well as collaborating on reviews to be the two most important features of Rayyan. As of November 2016, Rayyan users exceed 2000 from over 60 countries conducting hundreds of reviews totaling more than 1.6M citations. Feedback from users, obtained mostly through the app web site and a recent survey, has highlighted the ease in exploration of searches, the time saved, and simplicity in sharing and comparing include-exclude decisions. The strongest features of the app, identified and reported in user feedback, were its ability to help in screening and collaboration as well as the time savings it affords to users.

In this retrospective study, 62 children with pectus excavatum admitted to our hospital were divided into two groups: group A (3-12 years old) and group B (>12 years old), with 31 cases in each group. All of them were treated with NUSS. The treatment effectiveness, perioperative indexes (operation time, blood loss, ground time, and hospitalization time), degree of chest flatness, cardiopulmonary function, bone metabolism indicators, and complications were compared between the two groups. There was no significant difference between patients in the two groups in terms of operation time, blood loss, ground time, and hospitalization time (all P>0.05). The overall response rate to treatment in group A (93.55%) was higher than that of group B (70.97%; P<0.05). Three months after the operation, the chest flatness as well as serum alkaline phosphatase and its bone isoform levels in both groups were decreased, while left ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac index, stroke volume, FEV1, and peak expiratory flow levels were increased compared to before the operation, and the improvement in the above indicators of group A was better than Group B (all P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications between the two groups (16.13% vs. 9.68%; P>0.05). NUSS surgery can achieve satisfactory results in treating children with pectus excavatum at different ages. However, in a certain age range, a younger age indicates a better effect.

The initial 118 consecutive Nuss procedures in 117 patients were retrospectively reviewed with approval of the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin human rights review board. Patient, surgical, complication, and pain descriptors were collected for each case. Statistical methods for comparison of pain strategies included the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality, 1-way repeated measures analysis of variance, and paired t tests. Patient, surgical, and complication descriptors were comparable to other large series. Complication rates were 7% early and 25% late. Epidural success rate was 96.4%. There was 1 episode of recurrence 2 years postbar removal (n = 114). The institution of the Nuss procedure provides a highly desired result with significant complication rates. The ideal approach would deliver this result with lower risk. A pain service-driven epidural administration of morphine or hydromorphone with local anesthetic provides excellent analgesia for patients after Nuss procedure. The success of epidural analgesia is independent of catheter site and adjunctive medications. Ketorolac was an effective breakthrough medication. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The recommendations do not apply to pain related to sickle cell disease or cancer or to patients receiving palliative or end-of-life care. The guideline addresses the following four areas: 1) determining whether or not to initiate opioids for pain, 2) selecting opioids and determining opioid dosages, 3) deciding duration of initial opioid prescription and conducting follow-up, and 4) assessing risk and addressing potential harms of opioid use. CDC developed the guideline using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Recommendations are based on systematic reviews of the scientific evidence and reflect considerations of benefits and harms, patient and clinician values and preferences, and resource allocation. CDC obtained input from the Board of Scientific Counselors of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (a federally chartered advisory committee), the public, and peer reviewers. CDC recommends that persons with pain receive appropriate pain treatment, with careful consideration of the benefits and risks of all treatment options in the context of the patient's circumstances. Recommendations should not be applied as inflexible standards of care across patient populations.

One patient returned to the ED owing to pain. 116 unique pain scores were obtained from 114 patients: score 0 (n = 69, 59%), 1-3 (n = 31, 27%), 4-5 (n = 11, 9%), 6-8 (n = 5, 4%), and 9-10 (n = 0, 0%). There was a positive association between pain and increasing age (r = 0.26, p = 0.005). No patients who underwent hernia repair reported a pain score greater than 3. Adequate pain control at discharge after pediatric general surgical procedures can be achieved for most children with scheduled nonopioid medications only. A limited supply of opioids for analgesia after discharge may benefit small subset of patients. This strategy would help reduce opioid prevalence in the community. Retrospective cohort study.

Predictors of recurrence after surgery are important in this group of young patients. The purpose of this study was to assess the short- and long-term outcomes of both PE and PC and identify factors associated with postoperative complications and pectus recurrence. This was a retrospective observational study that included all patients who underwent primary or recurrent repair of PC and PE in a regional thoracic centre over 20 years. Patients' demographics, type of surgery, complications and recurrence were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors predictive of pectus recurrence. A total of 297 patients were included (262 men and 35 women). The mean age was 19.8 years (95% CI 19.3-20.5). A total of 169 patients had surgery for PE and 127 for PC. A total of 243 patients had a modified Ravitch procedure (166 without a bar) and 53 patients underwent the Nuss repair. The main postoperative complications were wound infection and bleeding or haematoma. The recurrence rate over the mean follow-up period of 8.6 years was 10%. In PE, patients treated with the Ravitch procedure with the bar experienced more complications. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that PE patients who developed a complication had a significantly increased chance of recurrence. No risk factors were linked with recurrence of PC. Life-transforming pectus surgery can be performed with low morbidity and good long-term outcomes. Recurrence of PE deformity is associated with the development of postoperative complications. © The Author 2016.

The influence of hospital center volume on postoperative outcomes in children is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the outcomes of children undergoing Pectus repair, stratified by hospital surgical volume. The Nationwide Readmission Database was queried (2016-2020) for patients with Pectus (Q67.6). Patients were stratified into those who received repair at high-volume centers (HVCs; ≥20 repairs annually) versus low-volume centers (LVCs; <20 repairs annually). Demographics and outcomes were analyzed using standard statistical tests. A total of 9414 patients with Pectus underwent repair during the study period, with 69% treated at HVCs and 31% at LVCs. Patients at LVCs experienced higher rates of complications during index admission, including pneumothorax (23% vs. 15%), chest tube placement (5% vs. 2%), and overall perioperative complications (28% vs. 24%) compared to those treated at HVCs, all p < 0.001. Patients treated at LVCs had higher readmission rates within 30 days (3.8% vs. 2.8% HVCs) and overall readmission (6.8% vs. 4.7% HVCs), both p < 0.010. Among readmitted patients (n = 547), the most frequent complications during readmission for those initially treated at LVCs included pneumothorax/hemothorax (21% vs. 8%), bar dislodgment (21% vs. 12%), and electrolyte disorders (15% vs. 9%) compared to those treated at HVCs. Pediatric Pectus repair performed at high-volume centers was associated with fewer index complications and readmissions compared to lower-volume centers.

Complications are dependent not only on the technique used and the patient's age, but also on the experience of the treating surgeon. The authors present their 15 years' experience with surgical correction of pectus carinatum and the complications that have occurred. A literature review regarding complications with pectus carinatum surgery is performed. A retrospective review of 95 patients (mean age, 19 years) was performed. One hundred four surgical procedures for repair of pectus carinatum were performed from July of 2000 to July of 2015 using a modified Ravitch technique, bioabsorbable material, postoperative bracing, and in some cases a diced rib cartilage graft technique. Intraoperative and postoperative complications were evaluated. The mean patient follow-up was 13.6 months (range, 4 months to 9.75 years). Intraoperative complications were pleura lesion and laceration of the internal mammary vein. Postoperative complications were recurrent mild protrusion, persistent protrusion of one or two costal cartilages, minor wound healing delay, skin ulcer, hypertrophic scar, transient intercostal dysesthesia, marginal pneumothorax, seroma, meningitis, and epidural hematoma. In our reported series of pectus carinatum repair, increasing experience and progressively less extensive techniques have resulted in fewer complications, low morbidity, and early return to activity. Complications were observed in the early period of application, predominantly because of a lack of experience, and usually subsided with increasing numbers of patients and frequency of surgery.

In this context, we propose a different approach for minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE) including preoperative planning, ambulatory template fitting, and implant customization. We prospectively collected data on 130 consecutive patients who underwent a novel process of implant customization for MIRPE between November 2015 and September 2019 at our institution. This process consisted of: 1) preoperative planning using 3D computed tomography scan reconstruction and 3D printing of the implant template, 2) an ambulatory fitting session with the template, and 3) manufacture of a custom made, prebent, metallic implant based on the 3D printed templates. We described the process in detail and analyzed the \"implant-deformity\" match, need for rebending, modification of the curvature or shape of the pectus implant intraoperatively, and accuracy of the number of bars planned preoperatively. Preoperative planning including 3D reconstruction and printing resulted in a 92.3% optimal \"implant-deformity\" anatomic match. Minimal rebending without flipping of the implants was required in 5.4% of the patients. In two cases (1.5%), the implants were too short, and they tended to sink into the intercostal space, and in one case (0.8%), the patient's chest was extremely asymmetric, and the implant had to be removed and rebent intraoperatively. The number of implants planned preoperatively was precise in 100%. In this study, we demonstrated that minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum assisted by preoperative planning, ambulatory template fitting, and implant customization enables an excellent anatomic match, leading to minimal rebending, and avoiding implant flipping or removal after retrosternal passage as well as accuracy in the number of bars programmed preoperatively.

Preoperative spirometry was normal, and echocardiogram showed light aortic valve dilation. A month later, during a routine outpatient checkup, he referred middle abdominal pain, denying respiratory symptoms nor thoracic pain. He presented bilateral apical and right basal hypophonesis. Chest X-ray revealed bilateral pneumothorax and right pleural effusion. Consequently, the patient was admitted to the emergency room, and a chest computed tomography was ordered, reporting right apical blebs. Bilateral thoracoscopy was performed, and apexes were checked for pulmonary blebs to rule out primary pneumothorax. In the right chest, a wedge resection of a distorted area on the apex and pleuroabrasion were done. Four air leaking eschars were found when performing lung expansion under water as leaking test, corresponding to cryoanalgesia intercostal eschars, and subsequently closed by primary suture. In the left chest, there were no blebs. However, another four pleural lesions with intact pleura in the left lower lobe were also found. Postoperative course was uneventful and chest drains were removed 48 hours after surgery. He remains asymptomatic 21 months after discharge.

Ultrasound-guided percutaneous cryoanalgesia of intercostal nerves constitutes a valid option for adequate postoperative analgesia. A key issue for a successful cryoanalgesia is placing the cryoprobe tip close to the intercostal nerve. This report describes an ultrasound technique using a high-resolution ultrasound probe to accomplish this goal. Images of five anesthetized patients undergoing uniportal video-thoracoscopic surgeries are used as clinical examples. In the lateral position, a high-frequency 12 MHz probe is placed longitudinally at 5-7 cm parallel to the spine at the 4th, 5th, and 6th ipsilateral intercostal spaces. Ultrasound images detect the intercostal neurovascular bundle and a 14G angiocath is placed beside the nerve. The cryoprobe is inserted throughout the 14G catheter and the cryoanalgesia cycle is performed for 3 min. Two ultrasound signs confirm the right cryoprobe position close to the nerve: one is a color Doppler twinkling artifact that is seen as the quick shift of colors that delineates the cryoprobe contour. The other is a spherical hypoechoic image caused by the ice ball formed at the cryoprobe tip. Ultrasound images obtained with a high-frequency probe allow precise location of the cryoprobe tip close to the intercostal nerve for cold axonotmesis. © 2022. The Author(s).", "mesh": []}

The absence of objective measures of normative postoperative recovery creates uncertainty about the postdischarge period, which remains highly dependent on the patients' and their caregivers' expectations and management of recovery. We aimed to describe an objective-normative, physical activity recovery trajectory after the modified Nuss procedure, using step counts from the Fitbit. This observational study enrolled children ≤18 y with pectus excavatum who underwent the modified Nuss procedure from 2021 to 2022. The Fitbit was worn for 21 postoperative days. Postdischarge outcomes and health-care utilization were evaluated. For patients without postoperative complications, piecewise linear regression analysis was conducted to generate a normative recovery trajectory model of daily step counts. Of 80 patients enrolled, 66 (86%) met eligibility criteria (mean age, 15.1 ± 1.3 y; 89.4% male, 62.1% non-Hispanic White). The mean number of telephone and electronic message encounters regarding concerns with the patient's recovery within 30 d postoperatively was 2.1 (standard deviation = 2.7). Ten patients (15.2%) returned to the emergency department (ED) within the 30-d postoperative period. Seven patients (10.6%) presented to the ED one time, and three patients (4.5%) presented to the ED twice. Thirty-day readmission rate was four patients (6.0%). Piecewise regression model showed that patients without complications steadily increased their daily step count on each postoperative day and plateaued on day 18. We have developed a normative recovery trajectory following the modified Nuss procedure using step count data collected by a consumer wearable device. This offers the potential to inform preoperative patient expectations and reduce avoidable health-care utilization through informed preoperative counseling, thus laying the ground work for the use of consumer wearable devices as a postdischarge remote monitoring tool.

The primary outcome was opioid consumption throughout the entire hospitalization, at postoperative day (POD) 7 and at POD 14 addressed with Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME). The secondary outcomes were maximum reported pain score at POD 7, hospital length of stay (LOS) and time until extubation. Mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for continuous outcomes. A total of 5 studies encompassing 485 patients undergoing lung transplantation were included, of whom 228 underwent cryoanalgesia.

CONSORT (CONsortium to Study Opioid Risks and Trends) includes adult members of 2 health plans serving over 1% of the US population. Opioid use episodes beginning in the years 1997 to 2005 were classified as acute, episodic, long-term/lower dose, or long-term/higher dose. On the basis of evaluation of the likelihood of opioid use continuing, long-term opioid therapy was defined by episodes lasting longer than 90 days with 10+ opioid prescriptions or 120+ days supply of opioids dispensed. Long-term/higher dose episodes (<1.5% of all opioid use episodes) were characterized by daily or near daily use, a mean duration of about 1000 days, and an average daily dose of about 55 mg. They accounted for more than half the total morphine equivalents dispensed from the years 1997 to 2006. Short-acting, non-Schedule II opioids (eg, hydrocodone with acetaminophen) were, by far, the most commonly prescribed medications for acute, episodic, and long-term episodes. Long-acting (sustained-release) opioids were the predominately prescribed medication in a minority of long-term episodes (6% to 12%). Long-term opioid therapy was characterized by the diversity in medications prescribed, dosage levels, and frequency of use. The proposed threshold for long-term opioid therapy provides a checkpoint for physicians to review whether an explicit decision to sustain opioid therapy has been reached, and to ensure that a documented treatment plan and provisions for monitoring medication use and patient outcomes are in place.", "mesh": ["Analgesics, Opioid", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Drug Prescriptions", "Humans", "Pain", "Pain Measurement", "Quality of Life", "Retrospective Studies", "Time Factors"]}

The aim was to determine the incidence, nature, and severity of serious clinical incidents (SCIs) associated with the techniques of continuous opioid infusion, patient-controlled analgesia, and nurse-controlled analgesia in patients aged 0-18. The audit was funded by the Association of Paediatric Anaesthetists (APA) and performed by the acute pain services of 18 centers throughout the United Kingdom. Data were submitted weekly via a web-based return form designed by the Document Capture Company that documented data on all patients receiving opioid infusions and any SCIs. Eight categories of SCI were identified in advance, and the reported SCIs were graded in terms of severity (Grade 1 (death/permanent harm); Grade 2 (harm but full recovery and resulting in termination of the technique or needing significant intervention); Grade 3 (potential but no actual harm). Data were collected over a period of 17 months (25/06/07-25/11/08) and stored on a secure server for analysis. Forty-six SCIs were reported in 10 726 opioid infusion techniques. One Grade 1 incident (1 : 10,726) of cardiac arrest occurred and was associated with aspiration pneumonitis and the underlying neurological condition, neurocutaneous melanosis. Twenty-eight Grade 2 incidents (1 : 383) were reported of which half were respiratory depression. The seventeen Grade 3 incidents (1 : 631) were all drug errors because of programming or prescribing errors and were all reported by one center. The overall incidence of 1 : 10,000 of serious harm with opioid infusion techniques in children is comparable to the risks with pediatric epidural infusions and central blocks identified by two recent UK national audits (1,2). Avoidable factors were identified including prescription and pump programming errors, use of concurrent sedatives or opioids by different routes and overgenerous dosing in infants.

Repair may be offered via Nuss or Ravitch technique. This study aims to investigate the outcomes of these repairs using a national cohort. The Nationwide Readmission Database was queried from 2016 to 2020 for patients aged 12-21 y old with pectus excavatum. Demographics, hospital characteristics, and outcomes were analyzed using standard statistical tests. The results were weighted for national estimates. A total of 10,053 patients with pectus excavatum underwent repair (86% Nuss, n = 8673 and 14% Ravitch, n = 1380). Baseline characteristics were similar between cohorts. Nuss repair patients traveled more frequently out of state for repair (10.5% versus 8.7%) and were in the highest income quartiles (61.1% versus 57.3%), both P < 0.05. Of reporting hospitals, 60% performed only the Nuss procedure. The Ravitch cohort experienced higher rates of complications during index admission, including chest tube placement (5.1% versus 2.2%), bleeding (2.4% versus 0.6%), air leak (0.9% versus 0.3%), and respiratory failure (1.0% versus 0.3%), as well as longer median length of stay (4 versus 3 d), all with a P value < 0.05. While both cohorts had similar overall readmission rates, Ravitch repairs had higher rates of readmissions for bleeding (18.3% versus 4.5%), pain (32.9% versus 13.5%), and psychiatric complications (31.7% versus 21.2%), all with a P value < 0.05. Ravitch repairs also incurred higher total hospital costs ($18,670 versus 17,462, P < 0.001). Nuss repairs were associated with fewer index complications with no increase in readmissions compared to Ravitch procedures. However, disparities may exist in access to Nuss repair.

The aim of this study was to extend the empirical support of the 21-item Child Activity Limitations Interview (CALI-21), a well-validated measure of activity limitations, using a large, multisite sample and to develop a brief form of the measure with more interpretable scoring. A sample of 1616 youth and 1614 parents completed the CALI-21 at an initial appointment in 1 of 3 pain specialty clinics in the Midwest or Northwest United States, or as part of a research study after this initial visit. All youth also reported on usual pain intensity. The CALI-21 data from 1236 youth and parents were used in analyses. Results of the exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a common 2-factor structure (Active and Routine factors) for both child- and parent-report versions. Using item reduction, the 9-item measure (CALI-9) was developed with both child and parent versions showing good internal consistency and high cross-informant reliability. Initial validity was shown by the ability of the CALI-9 to distinguish by level of pain intensity. Findings suggest that the CALI-9 is a promising brief tool for the evaluation of pain-related activity limitations in youth with chronic pain and for proxy report by parents.

The surgery is associated with significant postoperative pain and lengthy hospital stays. We hypothesized that a standardized enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway would result in significantly reduced length of stay (LOS) and reduced levels of postoperative pain without an increase in readmissions or emergency department (ED) visits. We instituted a pectus excavatum ERAS program at a high-volume academic center. Our ERAS protocol standardized perioperative exercise and pharmacologic regimens, pre- and post-operative education, and early return to activity. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients undergoing the Nuss procedure from 2015 to 2018. ERAS was implemented at the mid-point of the study period, and pre- and post-protocol patients were compared in our analysis. The primary outcome measure was LOS. The secondary outcomes included pain scores, incidence of urinary retention, and readmissions or ED visits. One hundred nine patients were included in this study (51 patients pre-ERAS and 58 post-ERAS). The average length of hospitalization prior to implementation of ERAS was 3.49 and after the implementation 2.90 (p = 0.0007). The implementation of ERAS showed a trend of decreasing readmissions and emergency department visits, but this did not reach statistical significance. There was a statistically significant decrease in both requirement for urinary catheter placement and pain scores on postoperative day 0. Implementation of ERAS for the Nuss procedure leads to a significant reduction in LOS, early pain scores, and urinary catheter usage, without an increase in post-operative ED visits and hospital readmissions. An ERAS protocol should be utilized in this patient population. Retrospective comparative study. Level III. Copyright © 2020.

Some patients have developed chest wall dermatological symptoms after INC that can be mistaken for metal allergy or infection. The purpose of this study is to report the symptoms, severity, incidence, and treatment of post-cryoablation dermatitis. A retrospective single institution review was performed for patients who underwent SCOPE with and without INC between June 2016 and March 2023 to assess for incidence of postoperative dermatological findings. Characteristics associated with these findings were evaluated. During study period, 383 patients underwent SCOPE, 165 (43.1%) without INC and 218 (56.9%) with. Twenty-three (10.6%) patients who received INC developed exanthems characteristic of post-cryoablation dermatitis with two distinct phenotypes identified. No patients who underwent SCOPE without INC developed similar manifestations. Early dermatitis, characterized by a painless, erythematous, and blanching rash across the anterior thorax, was observed in 16 patients, presenting on median postoperative day 6.0 [IQR 6.0-8.5], with median time to resolution of 23.0 [IQR 12-71.0] days after symptom onset. Late dermatitis, characterized by hyperpigmentation spanning the anterior thorax, was observed in 7 patients, presenting on median postoperative day 129.0 [IQR 84.5-240.0], with median time to resolution of 114.0 [IQR 48.0-314.3] days. This is the first report of dermatological manifestations following SCOPE with INC, a phenomenon of unknown etiology and no known long-term sequela.

Preoperative evaluation of defect severity typically requires a calculation of the Haller index (HI) and/or correction index (CI) using computed tomography (CT) or x-rays. The purpose of this study was to determine whether physician-estimated depth (PED), a bedside screening tool, could be used to identify a subset of pediatric patients in whom CT was unnecessary. After institutional review board approval (IRB #032018-091), we retrospectively reviewed all patients with a diagnosis of PE between 2009 and 2018 at our academic pediatric center. Demographic information including age, sex, and body mass index were abstracted. Imaging was reviewed to obtain HI and CI and to retrospectively calculate PED. The PED is calculated at the bedside by measuring the depth of the pectus at the site of greatest depression relative to a horizontal surface laid across the deformity. For this retrospective study, we calculated the CT-derived PED by measuring the depth from the horizontal on the respective CT images. Patients without imaging studies and patients with pectus carinatum, arcuatum, or mixed deformities were excluded from this study. A total of 94 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 82% were male, with a median age of 15 y. Patients were further subdivided by BMI, with 46% of patients having a BMI of <18.5 kg/m2 (i.e., underweight), whereas 54% of patients had a BMI of ≥18.5 kg/m2. Using a threshold PED of 2 cm, patients with a BMI of <18.5 kg/m2 had correct classification rates of 93% and 95% using PED relative to HI and CI, respectively. Patients with a BMI of ≥18.5 kg/m2 had correct classification rates of 80% and 88% using PED relative to HI and CI, respectively, at the same 2 cm threshold. PED is a viable screening tool for the preoperative evaluation of PE with a 2 cm threshold providing the combination of high sensitivity, specificity, and correct classification rates especially in underweight patients.

This article describes the current state of research focusing on prescription opioid misuse (POM) among adolescents and emerging adults (A/EAs) in the U.S. Given the rapidly changing nature of the opioid epidemic, we applied PRISMA Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines to identify empirical articles published in the past 5 years (January 2013-September 2018) from nine databases examining POM among A/EAs (ages 10-25) in the U.S. Seventy-six articles met our inclusion criteria focusing on POM in the following areas: cross-sectional surveys (n = 60), longitudinal cohort studies (n = 5), objective, non-self-reported data sources (n = 9), and interventions (n = 2). Final charted data elements were organized by methodology and sample, with results tables describing design, sample, interventions (where applicable), outcomes, and limitations. Most studies focused on the epidemiology of POM and risk/protective factors, including demographic (e.g., sex, race), individual (e.g., substance use, mental health), and social (e.g., peer substance use) factors. Despite annual national surveys conducted, longitudinal studies examining markers of initiation and escalation of prescription opioid misuse (e.g., repeated overdoses, time to misuse) are lacking. Importantly, few evidence-based prevention or early intervention programs were identified. Future research should examine longitudinal trajectories of POM, as well as adaptation and implementation of promising prevention approaches. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In total, 1,526 patients who underwent minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum surgery from 2013 to 2022 were enrolled and analyzed. We have pursued a new paradigm of crane-powered remodeling of the entire chest wall. The method of bar stabilization has changed from claw fixators to hinge plates and, finally, to bridge plate connections. We also evaluated the effectiveness of the hinge plate (group H) and the bridge plate (group B). The bar displacement rates were 0.1% (n=2) for the claw fixator, 0% for the hinge plate (n=0), and 0% for the bridge plate (n=0). We stopped using the claw fixator in 2022 and the hinge plate in 2019. Since 2022, when we shifted to a multiple-bar technique for all patients, the bridge plate has replaced both the claw fixator and the hinge plate. No bar displacement occurred in either group. Group H had more pleural effusion, wound problems (p<0.05), and longer stays (5.5 vs. 6.2 days, p=0.034) than group B. We have made significant progress in pectus repair surgery over the last decade, particularly in stabilizing the pectus bar and reducing perioperative complications.

Prospective, panel data come from the Monitoring the Future study. The analysis uses a nationally representative sample of 6220 individuals surveyed in school in 12th grade and then followed up through age 23. Analyses are stratified by predicted future opioid misuse as measured in 12th grade on the basis of known risk factors. The main outcome is nonmedical use of a prescription opioid at ages 19 to 23. Predictors include use of a legitimate prescription by 12th grade, as well as baseline history of drug use and baseline attitudes toward illegal drug use. Legitimate opioid use before high school graduation is independently associated with a 33% increase in the risk of future opioid misuse after high school. This association is concentrated among individuals who have little to no history of drug use and, as well, strong disapproval of illegal drug use at baseline. Use of prescribed opioids before the 12th grade is independently associated with future opioid misuse among patients with little drug experience and who disapprove of illegal drug use. Clinic-based education and prevention efforts have substantial potential to reduce future opioid misuse among these individuals, who begin opioid use with strong attitudes against illegal drug use.

Modifications to the shape of the bar including asymmetric and seagull bars were developed to deal with these types of asymmetry. A double bar or compound bar technique was used in most of the adults. Multipoint wire fixations to ribs were utilized to prevent bar rotation. Postoperative complications included pneumothorax (n = 24, 7.5%) and bar displacement (n = 11, 3.4%). The bar was removed in 42 patients 2 years after the initial procedure.

Given the limited understanding in these trends among adolescents, we examine national trends in the medical and nonmedical use of prescription opioids among high school seniors between 1976 and 2015. The data used for the study come from the Monitoring the Future study of adolescents. Forty cohorts of nationally representative samples of high school seniors (modal age 18) were used to examine self-reported medical and nonmedical use of prescription opioids. Lifetime prevalence of medical use of prescription opioids peaked in both 1989 and 2002 and remained stable until a recent decline from 2013 through 2015. Lifetime nonmedical use of prescription opioids was less prevalent and highly correlated with medical use of prescription opioids over this 40-year period. Adolescents who reported both medical and nonmedical use of prescription opioids were more likely to indicate medical use of prescription opioids before initiating nonmedical use. Prescription opioid exposure is common among US adolescents. Long-term trends indicate that one-fourth of high school seniors self-reported medical or nonmedical use of prescription opioids. Medical and nonmedical use of prescription opioids has declined recently and remained highly correlated over the past 4 decades. Sociodemographic differences and risky patterns involving medical and nonmedical use of prescription opioids should be taken into consideration in clinical practice to improve opioid analgesic prescribing and reduce adverse consequences associated with prescription opioid use among adolescents.

Cultural differences or assumptions about the financing of medical care in different countries encourage creative adaptation of general assumptions in local communities. The aim of this study was to compare the quality of the perioperative period before and after the introduction of an interdisciplinary protocol adopted to organisational conditions. A group of 4098 children were included in the \"before-after\" observational study. The data of 1553 patients (BEFORE group) were analysed in terms of compliance with the enhanced recovery after surgery protocol guidelines and the time and cost of hospitalisation over a 20-month period. A novel interdisciplinary protocol was developed, including an education and training app called BackOnFeet (BOF®), standardised hospital management, and the introduction of methods novel to Poland (intraoperative nerve cryoanalgesia in children). A further 2545 patients (AFTER group) were reassessed over a period of 20 months. It was found that the groups differed in hospitalisation time (p < 0.001), type of procedures, and percentage ratio of costs incurred to revenue generated. The usefulness of the BOF® app as an effective educational tool was demonstrated. The optimisation of perioperative management in paediatric orthopaedics based on novel tools and the interdisciplinary ERAS protocol is possible and brings tangible benefits in psychological, organisational, and financial terms.", "mesh": []}

This study aimed to generate data on prescription opioid misuse trajectories across adolescence and identify risk factors and mechanisms for more dangerous use trajectories. Using a prospective longitudinal cohort repeated measures design, baseline (Fall 2013) and seven semiannual assessments were administered through Spring 2017 in 10 public high schools in Los Angeles, CA. Frequency of past 30-day prescription opioid misuse was captured. Trajectory groups were identified using growth mixture modeling and multinomial logistic regression identified associations between baseline risk factors with membership in each trajectory group. Overall, 3395 students were evaluated (53.4% female, Mean [SD] age at baseline=14.58[0.40]; range=12.83-16.29). Four discrete misuse trajectories were identified among 1062 students: (1) Minimal/Experimental (infrequent time-limited use; range of estimated mean number of days using prescription opioid across waves=0.0-0.6 days]; N = 705[20.8%]); (2) Low Deescalating (range=2.0-0.7 days; N = 189[5.6%]); (3) Moderate Escalating (range=0.7-3.6 days; N = 108[3.2%]); and (4) Frequent Persistent (range=4.7-9.4 days; N = 60[1.8%]). Students reporting tobacco, cannabis, alcohol use, or impulsivity in 9th grade were more likely to demonstrate membership in the Moderate Escalating trajectory class when compared to 2333 (68.7%) students reporting sustained abstinence. Female sex, peer opioid misuse, alcohol use, other substance use, impulsivity, or delinquent behavior reported in 9th grade was associated with membership in the Frequent Persistent trajectory class. Prescription opioid misuse in adolescence appears to follow 4 discrete trajectories, including the potentially problematic Moderate Escalating and Frequent Persistent trajectories. Female sex, peer influences, substance use, and intrapersonal risk factors were associated with membership in these classes. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

However, knowledge about the epidemiology of the opioid crisis, opioid prescribing patterns, and the link between opioid prescribing and problematic opioid behaviors remain limited. Thus, children are often excluded from health care policies and guidelines aimed at curbing the opioid crises. The primary aim of this topical review is to provide a brief overview of the opioid crises affecting children, followed by a synopsis of recent research on opioid prescribing patterns and data on the links between legitimate opioid use and risk for problematic opioid use behaviors. This is a narrative review. Opioid misuse is a public health crisis facing children and adolescents in the United States and serves as a key antecedent for other problematic opioid behaviors, including opioid use disorder, heroin use, and opioid overdose. Furthermore, the United States experienced a significant increase in opioid prescribing to children and adolescents as compared with prescribing rates before the year 2000. Yet, data on the associations between opioid prescribing patterns and risk for problematic opioid use remains limited. There exist an urgent need to identify adolescents at increased risk for problematic opioid use behaviors following a receipt of medically prescribed opioids.

We performed a cross-sectional study evaluating prescribing patterns in the pediatric emergency department at an urban, academic, quaternary care children's hospital system for 6 months before and 6 months after the DEA rescheduling of HCPs. Differences in patient demographics, provider type, and diagnoses were assessed during the two time periods using Pearson's chi-squared test. The Breslow-Day statistic was used to assess differences in prescribing patterns by provider type. There were 1256 prescriptions for HCPs and CCPs in our pediatric emergency department during the study period, and only 36 prescriptions for alternate oral opioid medications. Prescriptions of all opioid pain medications decreased by 55% after rescheduling. The odds of prescribing HCPs were reduced by 60% after the DEA rescheduling (odds ratio 0.40 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.30-0.54]; p < 0.001). There was no difference between monthly ordering frequencies for CCPs before or after the DEA rescheduling (p = 0.75).

Modern cryoanalgesia traces its roots to Cooper et al who developed in 1961, a device that used liquid nitrogen in a hollow tube that was insulated at the tip and achieved a temperature of - 190 degrees C. Lloyd et al proposed that cryoanalgesia was superior to other methods of peripheral nerve destruction, including alcohol neurolysis, phenol neurolysis, or surgical lesions. The application of cold to tissues creates a conduction block, similar to the effect of local anesthetics. Long-term pain relief from nerve freezing occurs because ice crystals create vascular damage to the vasonervorum, which produces severe endoneural edema. Cryoanalgesia disrupts the nerve structure and creates wallerian degeneration, but leaves the myelin sheath and endoneurium intact. Clinical applications of cryoanalgesia extend from its use in craniofacial pain secondary to trigeminal neuralgia, posterior auricular neuralgia, and glossopharyngeal neuralgia; chest wall pain with multiple conditions including post-thoracotomy neuromas, persistent pain after rib fractures, and post herpetic neuralgia in thoracic distribution; abdominal and pelvic pain secondary to ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, genitofemoral, subgastric neuralgia; pudendal neuralgia; low back pain and lower extremity pain secondary to lumbar facet joint pathology, pseudosciatica, pain involving intraspinous ligament or supragluteal nerve, sacroiliac joint pain, cluneal neuralgia, obturator neuritis, and various types of peripheral neuropathy; and upper extremity pain secondary to suprascapular neuritis and other conditions of peripheral neuritis.

DLTs are sometimes difficult or even impossible to introduce, and the incidence of postoperative hoarseness and airway injuries is higher. Bronchial blockers are more difficult to position and need more frequent intraoperative repositioning. The design of a Y-shaped bronchial blocker, the EZ-Blocker (Teleflex Life Sciences Ltd., Athlone, Ireland) (EZB), combines some advantages of both techniques. The objective of this study was to assess whether EZB performs clinically better than left-sided DLTs (Broncho-cath; Mallinckrodt, Athlone, Ireland) without causing more injury. Primary outcome was the frequency of initial malpositions. Eligible patients were adults scheduled for surgery requiring one-lung ventilation who met criteria for placement of both devices. In this parallel trial, 100 consecutive and blinded patients were assigned randomly using a computer-generated list to two groups. The incidence of malposition and ease and time of placement were recorded. Blinded assessors investigated quality of lung deflation, postoperative complaints, and damage to the airway. Placement of a DLT was unsuccessful twice. The incidence of initial malposition was high and comparable between EZBs (37 of 50) and DLTs (42 of 49) (P = 0.212). Placing single-lumen tubes and EZBs took more time but was rated easier. Quality of lung deflation was comparable. Fewer patients in the EZB group complained of sore throat at day 1. There was a higher incidence of tracheal hematoma and redness and bronchial hematoma in the DLT group. The EZB is an efficient and effective device for one-lung ventilation and causes less injury and sore throat than a DLT.", "mesh": ["Adult", "Aged", "Bronchoscopy", "Double-Blind Method", "Equipment Design", "Female", "Hoarseness", "Humans", "Intubation, Intratracheal", "Male", "Middle Aged", "One-Lung Ventilation", "Pharyngitis", "Respiration, Artificial", "Treatment Outcome"]}

Twenty-six patients were given bilateral intercostal blocks after induction of anesthesia (PCA-IB group), and nineteen patients were retrospective controls without regional blockade (PCA group). All patients were followed up 24 h postoperatively. A loading dose of morphine (0,1±0,49 mg/kg) before starting PCA was used in seventeen patients in PCA group vs. no patient in PCA-IB group.

Patients who underwent pectus excavatum correction surgery at this center between April 2006 and March 2017 were divided into a DCCF system group and a conventional Nuss procedure group and their demographic, clinical, and surgical characteristics were compared. A total of 220 patients underwent the DCCF system procedure and 306 patients underwent the conventional Nuss procedure. The DCCF system group had significantly shorter operation time (p < 0.001) and postoperative hospital admission time (p < 0.001) compared with the conventional Nuss procedure group. There were only 2 cases (0.9%) of postoperative complications in the DCCF system group, which was significantly less than that of the conventional Nuss procedure group (n = 64, 20.9%; p < 0.001). In particular, there were no cases of bar displacement in the DCCF system group. The DCCF system was applied to surgical correction of pectus excavatum, which led to significant reduction in the operation time and postoperative hospital admission period, as well as reduced minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum complication and bar displacement rates.

The inclusion criteria focused on risk factors, stabilization techniques, and reoperation strategies. Data extraction and risk-of-bias assessments were independently conducted by multiple reviewers to ensure accuracy and quality. Thirteen studies spanning 23 years were included. Bar displacement rates varied widely (0.9%-33.3%), with key risk factors including patient age, chest wall rigidity, bar length, and placement technique. Advanced stabilization methods-such as bridge fixation, shorter bars, multipoint fixation, and adjunct stabilizers-significantly reduced displacement rates. Common postoperative complications included wound infections, seromas, pleural effusions, and bar re-dislocation. Imaging modalities like chest X-rays and 3-dimensional computed tomography scans proved critical for early detection. Heterogeneity in stabilization approaches underscores a shift toward patient-specific strategies to optimize outcomes. Tailored stabilization techniques are essential for successful PE correction. Although advancements in fixation methods have reduced displacement risks, standardized postoperative protocols and multicenter studies are needed to validate these innovations and improve long-term outcomes (PROSPERO: CRD42024595337).", "mesh": []}

Opioid overdoses have increased among all age groups, predominantly related to overprescribing and accessibility of opioids in the home. Adverse risks of prescribed opioids include respiratory depression, gastrointestinal distress, accidental ingestion, intentional misuse, new chronic use, diversion to another user, and overdose. Well-tolerated opioid prescribing practices include multimodal pain management; prescribing guided by patient need; risk assessment for potential misuse; and comprehensive patient and family education on risks, safe storage, and disposal practices. Evolving state laws will affect varying institutional policies; thus, providers must ensure their prescribing practices are current and compliant. All age groups have been affected by the opioid crisis, including children and adolescents. When managing postoperative pain, clinicians must balance appropriate pain management with well-tolerated opioid stewardship to minimize harm related to postoperative care.", "mesh": ["Adolescent", "Analgesics, Opioid", "Child", "Humans", "Opioid Epidemic", "Opioid-Related Disorders", "Pain, Postoperative", "Practice Patterns, Physicians'"]}

A public health response to the opioid crisis must expand its focus to more broadly include children, adolescents, and young adults while increasing efforts toward preventing new cases of opioid addiction, early identification of individuals with opioid-abuse disorder, and ensuring access to effective opioid addiction treatment, while simultaneously continuing to safely meet the needs of patients experiencing pain. Although a multimodal approach to pain management is fundamental in current practice, opioids remain an essential building block in the management of acute and chronic pain and have been for over 5000 years as they work. Left over, unconsumed opioids that were appropriately prescribed for pain have become the gateway for the development of opioid use disorder, particularly in the vulnerable adolescents and young adult patient populations. How to reduce the amount of opioids dispensed, improve methods of disposal in an environmentally safe way, and proactively make naloxone, particularly nasal spray, readily available to patients (and their families) receiving prescription opioids or who are at risk of opioid use disorder are highlighted in this review. We describe the historical use of opioids and the scope of the current opioid crisis, review the differences between dependence and addiction, and the private and public sectors response to pain management and highlight the issue of adolescent vulnerability.

Data were collected prospectively for 19 children (4 to 17 years of age; 15 boys, 4 girls) who underwent pectus excavatum (14) or carinatum (5) repair between June 1, 1991 and July 1, 1994. Seventeen had a thoracic epidural catheter placed for postoperative pain control and two did not. The epidural catheter was routinely plead preoperatively by the anesthesiologist at the T3-T8 level, after induction of general anesthesia. Epidural catheters were test-dosed with local anesthesia alone or in combination with fentanyl, and afterward a continuous epidural infusion was maintained on the floor. Postoperative pain was assessed by nursing and house staff on the Wong-Baker scale, with adjustment of the dose rate or analgesic medication as appropriate. All patients had extubation before leaving the operating room and were sent to the general pediatrics ward after leaving the recovery room. The average duration of the epidural was 69 hours (range, 20 to 116 hours). Sixteen patients received their test epidural dose preoperatively, and one patient had his in the recovery room. Fifteen epidural initially were dosed with bupivicaine (1 to 2 mg/kg) alone or in combination with fentanyl (1 to 2 micrograms/kg). Two patients received initial doses of lidocaine (1 to 1.5 micrograms/kg). Ten of 17 patients received fentanyl (1 microgram/kg/h) with bupivicaine (0.5 to 1.0 mg/kg/h) in the epidural as their maintenance medication, and the remainder received bupivicaine alone at the same dosage rate. Eight of 17 patients required additional intermittent supplemental narcotics, with an average of two doses of intravenous morphine per day (0.1 mg/kg) over the first 3 postoperative days. In contrast, the two patients who did not have an epidural catheter for pain control required high-dose intravenous morphine (0.2 mg/kg) every 2 to 3 hours for the first 3 to 4 postoperative days. No catheter-related complications occurred. Thoracic epidural analgesia was completely successful in nine (53%) children who underwent repair of pectus deformity, and effectively reduced the intravenous narcotic demand in the other eight. Pain control was excellent, and no catheter-related complications were encountered. The data show that this method of analgesia in children is a safe and attractive alternative to intravenous narcotics, and eliminates the potential disadvantages of sedation and respiratory compromise.", "mesh": ["Adolescent", "Analgesia, Epidural", "Analgesics, Opioid", "Anesthetics, Local", "Bupivacaine", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Drug Therapy, Combination", "Female", "Fentanyl", "Funnel Chest", "Humans", "Lidocaine", "Male", "Pain Measurement", "Pain, Postoperative", "Prospective Studies", "Sternum", "Vermont"]}

The treatment consists of a mini-computer-controlled infusion pump permitting the administration of on-demand, continuous, or combined doses of analgesic (mainly opioid) variations in response to therapy, which allows pain to be significantly controlled. Intravenous (IV)-PCA minimizes individual pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic differences and is widely accepted as a reference method for mild or severe postoperative pain. IV-PCA is the most studied route of PCA; other delivery methods have been extensively reported in the literature. In addition, IV-PCA usually voids the gap between pain sensation and analgesic administration, permitting better recovery and fewer side effects. The most commonly observed complications are nausea and vomiting, pruritus, respiratory depression, sedation, confusion and urinary retention. However, human factors such as pharmacy preparation and device programming can also be involved in the occurrence of these complications, while device failure is much less of an issue.", "mesh": []}

{"pmid": 28442931, "title": "Postoperative pain and patient-controlled epidural analgesia-related adverse effects in young and elderly patients: a retrospective analysis of 2,435 patients.", "abstract": "In this retrospective study, data of 2,435 patients who received fentanyl and ropivacaine-based patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) for pain relief after elective surgery under general or spinal anesthesia were reviewed. Differences in postoperative pain, incidence of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA)-related adverse effects, and risk factors for the need for rescue analgesics for 48 hours postsurgery in young (age 20-39 years) and elderly (age ≥70 years) patients were evaluated. Although there were no significant differences in postoperative pain intensity between the two groups until 6 hours postsurgery, younger patients experienced greater postoperative pain intensity compared with older patients 6-48 hours postsurgery. While younger patients exhibited greater incidence of numbness, motor weakness, and discontinuation of PCA postsurgery, elderly patients exhibited greater incidence of hypotension, nausea/vomiting, rescue analgesia, and antiemetic administration. Upon multivariate analysis, low fentanyl dosage and history of smoking were found to be associated with an increased need for rescue analgesia among younger patients, while physical status classification III/IV and thoracic surgery were associated with a decreased need for rescue analgesia among the elderly. Discontinuation of PCA was more frequent among younger patients than the elderly (18.5% vs 13.5%, P=0.001). Reasons for discontinuation of PCA among young and elderly patients, respectively, were nausea and vomiting (6.8% vs 26.6%), numbness or motor weakness (67.8% vs 11.5%), urinary retention (7.4% vs 8.7%), dizziness (2.2% vs 5.2%), and hypotension (3.1% vs 20.3%). In conclusion, PCEA was more frequently associated with numbness, motor weakness, and discontinuation of PCA in younger patients and with hypotension, nausea/vomiting, and a greater need for rescue analgesics/antiemetics among elderly patients. Therefore, in order to minimize the adverse effects of PCEA and enhance pain relief, different PCEA regimens and administration/prevention strategies should be considered for young and elderly patients.", "mesh": []}

Twenty-eight patients scheduled for thoracoscopic pectus excavatum surgery were randomly assigned to receive either thoracic epidural block or i.v. PCA for postoperative analgesia. Pain was assessed using a visual-analogue scale (VAS). The Ramsay sedation score, arterial pressure, ventilatory frequency, and heart rate were also measured, and blood gas analysis was performed regularly during the first 48 h after surgery. A significant decrease in the VAS pain score, Ramsay sedation score, heart rate ventilatory frequency, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and PaCO2, and a significant increase in PaO2 and oxygen saturation were found over time. Patients in the PCA group had significantly higher PaCO2 values. In addition, a significantly slower decline of systolic blood pressure and heart rate, and faster recovery of PaCO2 were found in PCA patients than in patients with epidural block.

This procedure is invasive and causes severe postoperative pain, which can affect the patient's postoperative sleep quality and, thus, the recovery process. To evaluate use of dezocine in patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) for postoperative pain management in patients undergoing total myomectomy. We selected 100 patients undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy for uterine fibroids and randomized them into two groups: A control group receiving 0.2% ropivacaine plus 0.06 mg/mL of morphine and an observation group receiving 0.2% ropivacaine plus 0.3 mg/mL of diazoxide in their PCEA. Outcomes assessed included pain levels, sedation, recovery indices, PCEA usage, stress factors, and sleep quality. The observation group showed lower visual analog scale scores, shorter postoperative recovery indices, fewer mean PCEA compressions, lower cortisol and blood glucose levels, and better polysomnographic parameters compared to the control group (P < 0.05). The cumulative incidence of adverse reactions was lower in the observation group than in the control group (P < 0.05). Dezocine PCEA can effectively control the pain associated with total myomectomy, reduce the negative impact of stress factors, and have less impact on patients' sleep, consequently resulting in fewer adverse effects. ©The Author(s) 2024.

We aimed to evaluate long-term outcomes and patient satisfaction after surgical correction. Patients who underwent pectus excavatum repair and subsequent bar removal at a single tertiary care center from January 2000 to December 2020 were identified. A retrospective chart review was performed, and a telephone survey was conducted to evaluate perceived inward chest movement, need for surgeon reevaluation, surgical reintervention, and overall satisfaction. Data are presented as medians with interquartile ranges (IQRs) and frequencies with percentages. A total of 583 patients were included. The survey response rate was 26.2% (n = 153). The respondents were predominantly male (80.4%, n = 123) with a median age at surgical correction of 14.9 years (IQR 12.9, 16.1) and a median Haller index (HI) of 3.8 (IQR 3.4, 4.5). Median time to bar removal was 2.9 years (IQR 2.5, 3.0) with a median age at removal of 17.7 years (IQR 15.5, 19.0). Median time from surgery to survey follow-up was 9.6 years (IRQ 5.0, 11.4) with respondents having a median age at follow-up of 25 years (IQR 22.0, 28.4).

Unnecessary variation in patient care and noncompliance with care bundles may be a factor in extended length of stay. The global aim of this quality improvement initiative was to successfully implement an enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) pathway on patients undergoing pectus excavatum repair. The SMART aim was to have a greater than 70% compliance for the perioperative bundle elements within 1 year of the pathway implementation. Multiple Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles were designed to create and implement an ERAS pathway for patients undergoing a pectus bar insertion procedure. This multidisciplinary pathway was designed, managed, and implemented with key stakeholders from the Departments of Evidence Based Practice, Surgery, Anesthesiology, and Perioperative Nursing. Patient characteristics, outcomes, and compliance with elements of the pathway were measured for analysis for both the baseline and post-intervention groups with monthly automated reports. After implementation of the ERAS pathway, data on the first 50 patients showed a 90% compliance with the perioperative bundle elements.

The objective of our study was to characterize the severity and duration of this pain, and to investigate possible associations with pectus severity. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients who underwent MIRPE from January 2014 to April 2018. Pectus excavatum (PE) severity was determined with 3 indices measured from computed tomography: Depression Index (DI), Correction Index (CI), and Haller index (HI). Mean pain scores for every 6-hour period and the presence of pain and intake of analgesics during follow-up were extracted from the medical record. The cohort included 57 patients with a mean age of 15.9 ± 1.3 years. All 3 severity indices were positively correlated, with a correlation coefficient of 0.8 between the DI and CI. The requirement for 2 bars was significantly associated with higher indices (95% CI:0.18-0.63, p = 0.01). Pain was managed with thoracic epidural analgesia for all but one patient. Growth linear modeling identified five different pain trajectory subgroups of patients up to post-operative day 5. None of the tested predictors (age, gender, body image, physical activity level, DI, CI, HI, difference deformity-epidural level) were significantly associated with class membership. Persistent pain at one-year follow-up was present in 18% of patients, all with severe deformity (DI≥0.8). Pain trajectory and intensity after MIRPE can be classified into discrete patterns but are not influenced by PE severity. Severe deformity seems to predict persistent pain at one year.

Adequate pain treatment, respiratory physiotherapy and early ambulation are key to improving the outcomes. Although thoracic epidural analgesia is highly effective, its safety is controversial, leading to extensive scrutiny and questioning of its role. We hypothesise that thoracic epidural analgesia is effective and well tolerated to use in adolescents, with a high success rate and low pain scores. Observational retrospective cohort study. All adolescent cases in a high-volume academic tertiary chest wall surgery centre between March 1993 and December 2017 were included. A total of 1117 patients aged from 12 to 19 years of age and receiving either Ravvitch, Nuss or Abramson chest wall reconstruction for pectus excavatum were identified in our institutional chest wall surgery database. After applying selection and exclusion criteria, 532 patients were included in the current analysis. The primary endpoint of this study was the safety of epidural analgesia, assessed by the incidence of acute adverse events. Secondary endpoints were block success rates using a specific novel definition, and analgesic efficacy using recorded postoperative pain scores. More than 60% of patients experienced one or more adverse events. However, all events were minor and without consequences. No serious or long-term adverse events were detected. The success rate of thoracic epidural placement was 81%. Low postoperative pain scores were observed. Thoracic epidural analgesia is an extremely effective pain control technique, with a surprisingly high number of minor adverse events but safe with regard to serious adverse events.

{"pmid": 29203521, "title": "Persistent Opioid Use Among Pediatric Patients After Surgery.", "abstract": "Despite efforts to reduce nonmedical opioid misuse, little is known about the development of persistent opioid use after surgery among adolescents and young adults. We hypothesized that there is an increased incidence of prolonged opioid refills among adolescents and young adults who received prescription opioids after surgery compared with nonsurgical patients. We performed a retrospective cohort study by using commercial claims from the Truven Health Marketscan research databases from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2014. We included opioid-naïve patients ages 13 to 21 years who underwent 1 of 13 operations. A random sample of 3% of nonsurgical patients who matched eligibility criteria was included as a comparison. Our primary outcome was persistent opioid use, which was defined as ≥1 opioid prescription refill between 90 and 180 days after the surgical procedure. Among eligible patients, 60.5% filled a postoperative opioid prescription (88 637 patients). Persistent opioid use was found in 4.8% of patients (2.7%-15.2% across procedures) compared with 0.1% of those in the nonsurgical group. Cholecystectomy (adjusted odds ratio 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.26) and colectomy (adjusted odds ratio 2.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-5.34) were associated with the highest risk of persistent opioid use. Independent risk factors included older age, female sex, previous substance use disorder, chronic pain, and preoperative opioid fill.

{"pmid": 27522122, "title": "The Minimally Invasive Repair of Pectus Excavatum Using a Subxiphoid Incision.", "abstract": "Purpose Several surgeons have documented outcomes following the Nuss operation. Most reports have described the use of thoracoscopy to avoid cardiac injury. Since 1999, our group has utilized a subxiphoid incision, allowing insertion of the surgeon's finger into the substernal space to help guide the bar across the mediastinum. Our initial experience has been reported and we are now reporting our entire experience to date. Methods A retrospective review was conducted on all patients who underwent pectus excavatum repair using a subxiphoid incision from December, 1999 to September, 2015. Results During the study period, 554 repairs were performed. A total of 80% of the patients were male. The mean age was 14.3 years ± 3.1, the mean operating time was 52 minutes ± 17.4, the mean length of stay was 4.2 days ± 1.1, and the mean time to bar removal was 2.7 years ± 0.7. A total of 20 patients (3.6%) received two bars. No patients sustained cardiac injury or evidence of pericarditis. Postoperatively, 22 patients (4%) developed an infection, either cellulitis or a local abscess requiring incision and drainage and/or antibiotics. In four of these 22 patients, the wound infection developed after the bar had been removed. Only one patient required bar removal before 2 years due to an infection. A total of 12 patients required either repositioning of the bar due to rotation (4) or removal of a stabilizer due to chronic discomfort (8), 2 required early bar removal for chronic pain, and 1 patient developed a tension pneumothorax in the operating room. A recurrence has developed in two patients but neither patient has desired correction. Conclusion In this relatively large series of patients, the addition of a subxiphoid incision to the technique has allowed for safe passage of the bar across the mediastinum to avoid cardiac injury during the Nuss operation.

The onset of increased EFP was rapid, and a peak of 23 cm H2O was reached within 90 minutes after injury. EFP levels returned to normal 32 days after freezing. The peak value represents the highest EFP yet recorded in an experimental neuropathy. Microscopic examination revealed severe vascular injury as the probable mechanism of edema, with leakage of horseradish peroxidase tracer at the site of injury and diapedesis of polymorphonuclear cells through vessel walls. Wallerian degeneration was also observed in segments of nerve distal to the site of injury. Analysis of EFP data revealed a biphasic pattern of endoneurial edema: initial marked pressure elevation subsides within hours but is followed by a second peak several days later. We interpret this to suggest superposition of two separate pathological processes following cold injury. At first, extensive vascular damage permits plasma and cellular extravasation, which rapidly increases EFP. Subsequently, nerve fibers undergo wallerian degeneration, a process associated with elevated EFP, which is maximal 6 days after injury.", "mesh": ["Animals", "Capillary Permeability", "Cell Membrane Permeability", "Edema", "Freezing", "Hydrostatic Pressure", "Intracellular Fluid", "Mast Cells", "Nerve Fibers, Myelinated", "Rats", "Rats, Inbred Strains", "Sciatic Nerve", "Wallerian Degeneration"]}

Expert opinion varies, though a 100 IV:10:EP:1 IT conversion ratio is commonly cited in the literature, especially for morphine. In this study, the authors surveyed 724 pain specialists to elucidate the ratios that respondents apply to convert high-dose IV morphine, hydromorphone, and fentanyl to both EP and IT routes. Eighty-three respondents completed the survey. Conversion ratios were calculated and entered into graphical scatter plots. The data suggest that there is wide variation in how pain specialists convert high-dose IV opioids to EP and IT routes. The 100 IV:10 EP:1 IT ratio was the most common answer of survey respondent, especially for morphine, though also for hydromorphone and fentanyl. Furthermore, more respondents applied a more aggressive conversion strategy for hydromorphone and fentanyl, likely reflecting less spinal selectivity of those opioids compared with morphine. The authors conclude that there is little consensus on this issue and suggest that in the absence of better data, a conservative approach to opioid conversion between IV and neuraxial routes is warranted.", "mesh": []}

MRsp involved the following three steps: 1. Lumbar spine computed tomography (CT) data were obtained to reconstruct virtual 3D images, which were imported into a HoloLens (2nd gen). 2. The patented MR system quickly recognized the spatial orientation and superimposed the virtual image over the real spine in the HoloLens. 3. The operator performed the spinal puncture with structural information provided by the virtual image. A posture fixation cushion was used to keep the subjects' lateral decubitus position consistent. 12 subjects were recruited to verify the setup error and the registration error. The setup error was calculated using the first two CT scans and measuring the displacement of two location markers. The projection points of the upper edge of the L3 spinous process (L3↑), the lower edge of the L3 spinous process (L3↓), and the lower edge of the L4 spinous process (L4↓) in the virtual image were positioned and marked on the skin as the registration markers. A third CT scan was performed to determine the registration error by measuring the displacement between the three registration markers and the corresponding real spinous process edges. The setup errors in the position of the cranial location marker between CT scans along the left-right (LR), anterior-posterior (AP), and superior-inferior (SI) axes of the CT bed measured 0.09 ± 0.06 cm, 0.30 ± 0.28 cm, and 0.22 ± 0.12 cm, respectively, while those of the position of the caudal location marker measured 0.08 ± 0.06 cm, 0.29 ± 0.18 cm, and 0.18 ± 0.10 cm, respectively. The registration errors between the three registration markers and the subject's real L3↑, L3↓, and L4↓ were 0.11 ± 0.09 cm, 0.15 ± 0.13 cm, and 0.13 ± 0.10 cm, respectively, in the SI direction.

The aim of this observational study was to explore proof of concept for the use of this technique in paediatric patients. Changes in pupil parameters before and after opioid exposure also were evaluated. This was a single-centre, prospective study conducted at an academic paediatric medical centre. Children 9-17 years of age undergoing elective surgical correction of pectus excavatum were enrolled into a protocol approved by the human ethical committee (institutional review board). Pupil size and reactivity were measured using a handheld pupillometer. Pain was assessed using age-appropriate, validated pain self-report scales. Thirty patients were enrolled. Each point change on a 10 cm visual analogue pain intensity scale was associated with a statistically significant mean change of 0.11 mm/s in maximum pupil constriction velocity, and of approximately 0.4% in pupil diameter. As expected, there was an association between total opioid dose (expressed as morphine equivalents) and pupil diameter. Age, sex and baseline anxiety scores did not correlate significantly with pupillary response. The association of maximum pupillary constriction velocity and diameter with pain scores illustrates the potential for using pupillometry as a non-invasive method to objectively quantitate pain response/intensity in children. The technique holds promise as a pharmacodynamic 'tool' to assess opioid response in paediatric patients. Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

We hypothesize that in-hospital outcomes improve with the addition of INCA to SSRF and potential increased hospital charges are justified by patient benefits. Multi-institutional, retrospective review of patients undergoing SSRF with and without INCA over an 8-year period. Institutions involved were Level II or higher trauma centers. Basic demographics were obtained. Patients were included if SSRF was performed during the index hospitalization. Primary outcomes included total hospital length of stay (HLOS) and HLOS after SSRF, total hospital charges (HC), HC the day of surgery and HC after surgery. Secondary outcome included total narcotic consumption in morphine milliequivalents (MME) after SSRF. Mann-Whitney U test was used for analysis. Statistical significance p < 0.05. 136 patients analyzed; 92 underwent SSRF only and 44 underwent SSRF with INCA. Demographics were similar between groups. Number of ribs stabilized was comparable; 4.78 ± 1.64 SSRF only and 4.73 ± 1.66 SSRF with INCA (p = 0.463). Median ISS [16 (IQR 11.5-16) SSRF only and 14 (IQR 9-18.75) SSRF with INCA (p = 0.463)] was not statistically different. The INCA group showed a decrease in the median total HLOS, 9 versus 10 days (U = 1517.5, p = 0.026) and HLOS after SSRF, 4 versus 6 days (U = 1217.5, p < 0.001). HC the day of surgery were higher for the INCA group, $93,932 versus $71,143 (U = 1106, p < 0.001). However, total HC were similar between groups and total HC after SSRF was significantly less for the INCA group, $10,556 versus $20,269 (U = 1327, p = 0.001). Total median narcotic use after SSRF was significantly less for the INCA group, 88.6 vs 113.7 MME (U = 1544.5, p = 0.026). SSRF with INCA is safe and does not increase overall HC with the added benefit of decreased HLOS post-operatively and decreased narcotic consumption. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This complication is commonly called rib flaring. This paper presents a technique to avoid rib flaring and evaluates its effectiveness. In our technique, a part of the seventh costal cartilage is removed, disconnecting the costal arch from the sternum. The effectiveness of this technique was evaluated in a retrospective clinical study of 63 pectus excavatum patients who were randomly collected and were divided into two groups. One group-defined as the Standard Group-includes 27 patients (29.8 ± 6.5SD y/o) on whom standard Nuss procedure was conducted; the other group-defined as the Separation Group-includes 36 patients (31.8 ± 6.1SD y/o) on whom the cartilage removal was conducted in addition to the standard Nuss procedure. The degree of postoperative costal-arch elevation was defined as ECA (Elevation of Costal Arch) and was compared between the two groups. ECA was significantly greater for the Standard Group (10.2 ± 3.3SD mm) than for the Separation Group (-1.1 ± 3.42SDmm). Postoperative protrusion of the costal arch is prevented by the separation of the seventh costal cartilage from the sternum.

Our pilot study aimed to investigate thoracoscopic IC's safety, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy for patients undergoing surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF). We hypothesized that concurrent surgical stabilization of rib fractures and intercostal nerve cryoablation (SSRF-IC) is a safe and feasible procedure without immediate or long-term complications. We retrospectively evaluated patients 18 years or older who underwent SSRF (with or without IC) for acute rib fractures at our level I trauma center between September 1, 2019, and September 30, 2020. We performed IC under thoracoscopic visualization (-70°C for 2 minutes per intercostal nerve bundle). Among patients whose only operative procedure during hospitalization was SSRF, we evaluated post-SSRF length of stay, operative times, opioid requirements (oral morphine equivalents), and pain scores (Numerical Rating Scale). Generalized estimating equations compared SSRF and SSRF-IC group outcomes (population mean [robust standard error]). We assessed long-term outcomes of patients who underwent SSRF-IC. Thirty-four patients (144 ribs) underwent SSRF; of these, 20 patients (135 ribs) underwent SSRF-IC. Patients who did and did not undergo concurrent IC had no significant difference demographic, injury, or hospitalization characteristics. Among 20 patients who did not undergo other operations, 12 underwent SSRF-IC. We did not find significant difference between SSRF and SSRF-IC groups' median operative times or post-SSRF length of stay. Compared with SSRF group, SSRF-IC group did not have statistically significant change in pain score (0.2 [1.5] lower) or opioid use (43.9 [86.1] mg/d greater) between 12 hours before SSRF and last 24 admission hours. Among 17 SSRF-IC patients who followed-up postdischarge (median [range], 160 [9-357] days), one reported mild chest wall paresthesia; no other complications were reported.

The act of converting opioid analgesics, for many physicians, nurses, and pharmacists, who do not receive adequate training, remains a challenging and often uncomfortable aspect of pain treatment. Part of the challenge clinicians face is secondary to the relatively weak literature evidence base that exists to support the equianalgesic ratios provided in textbooks, journals, and other medical resources. Another aspect involves the lack of a widely recognized treatment algorithm or guideline to assist clinicians with opioid conversion. The final decision on which opioid dose to prescribe must involve a thorough clinical assessment to minimize the risk of prescribing inappropriate opioid doses over or under the patient's actual need. The purpose of this paper is to provide the clinician with an approach for dealing with the conversion between opioid analgesics that is standardized, yet allows for individualized results to meet unique patient needs. We present a 5-step process as a guide for clinicians faced with the need to change a patient's opioid regimen. This approach may help to build a comfort level when dealing with the clinical challenges of converting from one opioid to another.", "mesh": ["Algorithms", "Analgesics, Opioid", "Case Management", "Clinical Protocols", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Administration Schedule", "Drug Monitoring", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pain", "Pain Measurement", "Practice Guidelines as Topic"]}

The majority of patients are treated for cosmetic purposes, with the modified Ravitch and Nuss procedures the most commonly performed. We tested the preferences of healthy individuals over their choice of procedure. METHODS The study was conducted from February to August 2014. A five-item illustrated questionnaire was administered to teenagers and young adults aged 14-26 years over their willingness to seek medical advice if they had PE, provided its cosmetic appearance was the only complaint. They were asked about their preference over the modified Ravitch and Nuss procedures, with the surgical details for both procedures explained by medical professionals, alongside illustrated outcomes. RESULTS Two hundred and two healthy individuals were interviewed. The median age was 19.5 years (14-26 years) and 141 (69.8%) were male. Sixty seven (33.2%) participants refused any intervention, while 11 (5.4%) initially wanted an intervention but refused after understanding the surgical procedures available. Of the 135 respondents who chose surgical correction, 84 (62.2%) preferred the modified Ravitch operation, while 51 (37.8%) preferred the Nuss procedure.

Surgery, as a common cause of acute pain in children, drives much of the opioid prescribing in pediatrics. Therefore, we sought to characterize opioid prescribing practices of pediatric surgeons by surveying members of the American Pediatric Surgery Association (APSA). After receiving approval from our institutional review board, we sent an online survey to the entire APSA membership. The survey included four vignettes of common pediatric surgical procedures with questions regarding analgesic prescribing practices, the rationale for these practices, and knowledge about opioid risk mitigation. Of 1127 APSA members contacted, 327 (29%) provided survey responses. For all vignettes, opioid prescribing was within standard ranges for 83% of respondents. Eighty-eight percent of respondents prescribed nonopioid pain medicine. Additionally, 25% reported routinely utilizing a prescription drug monitoring program, 64% did not tell patients how to dispose of opioids, and 37% did not know themselves how to dispose of leftover opioids. Prescribing by APSA surgeons is largely within standard ranges, but improvement is needed, particularly regarding opioid disposal. Procedure-specific consensus guidelines for opioid prescribing and opioid risk mitigation strategies are warranted. Observational study, level III. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

An intrathoracic system that minimizes incision length has recently been developed and adopted by multiple institutions. We hypothesized that SSRF with an intrathoracic system plus intercostal nerve cryoneurolysis (IC) leads to improved pain control compared with an extrathoracic system plus IC. A single-center, retrospective chart review was performed comparing intrathoracic SSRF versus extrathoracic SSRF, and included patients undergoing SSRF from 2015 to 2021 at a level 1 trauma center. Patients who did not undergo intercostal nerve cryoablation were excluded. The primary outcome was opioid consumption based on morphine milligram equivalent (MME) consumption. We collected Rib score, Blunt Pulmonary Contusion 18 Score, number of rib fractures, number of ribs plated, and Injury Severity Score (ISS) to compare baseline characteristics of each group. A total of 112 patients were evaluated for study inclusion. Thirty-one patients were excluded due to missing outcomes data and/or lack of cryoablation. There was no difference in ISS or Rib Score between the intrathoracic (n=33) and extrathoracic (n=48) groups. At 7-day follow-up, the median MME requirement was significantly lower in the intrathoracic group (21.25) versus the extrathoracic group (46.20) (p=0.02). Intrathoracic SSRF was associated with a lower postoperative MME consumption compared with extrathoracic SSRF.

Thus, the aim of this paper was to assess 1) the prevalence of abnormal routine coagulation parameters, i.e., international normalized ratio (INR) and platelet count, and 2) the safety of EA in patients undergoing MIRPE. In this retrospective study, we identified 1,973 patients undergoing MIRPE at our center between 2001 and 2019. Complications related to EA were registered for all patients. Information on coagulation parameters was present in 929 patients. Patients with spontaneously elevated INR ≥1.5 were referred for assessment of coagulation factor VII in order to assess the cause of the elevated INR. Of 929 patients with coagulation information available, 18 patients had spontaneously elevated INR ≥1.5 (1.9%). In patients with INR ≥1.5, 12 patients underwent further assessment of factor VII, with all patients having a slightly reduced factor VII close to the lower reference range. The majority of the 1,973 patients undergoing MIRPE received EA (99.6%) with very low complication rates (0.2%) and no incidence of epidural hematomas.

Two procedures are widely applied-the Nuss and the Ravitch. Several comparative studies are published evaluating both procedures with inconsistent results. Our objective was to compare the Nuss procedure to the Ravitch procedure using systematic review and meta-analysis methodology. All publications describing both interventions were sought through the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) database, MEDLINE, and EMBASE. The statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5 software. Odds ratios (OR) and weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals are presented. No randomized trials were identified. Nine prospective and retrospective studies were identified and were included in this study. There was no significant difference in overall complication rates between both techniques (OR, 1.75 (0.62-4.95); P = .30). Looking at specific complications, the rate of reoperation because of bar migration or persistent deformity was significantly higher in the Nuss group (OR, 5.68 (2.51-12.85); P = .0001). Also, postoperative pneumothorax and hemothorax were higher in the Nuss group (OR, 6.06 [1.57-23.48]; P = .009 and OR, 5.60 [1.00-31.33]; P = .05), respectively. Duration of surgery was longer with the Ravitch (WMD, 69.94 minutes (0.83-139.04); P = .05).

Among studies looking at patient satisfaction, there was no difference between both techniques. Our results suggest no differences between the Nuss procedure vs the Ravitch procedure with respect to overall complications, length of hospital stay, and time to ambulation.

In this review, we aim to summarize the evidence underlying peripheral nerve blockade, local anesthetic adjuncts, continuous peripheral nerve blockade and novel analgesic modalities, with the objective to provide recommendations on postoperative analgesia optimization after peripheral nerve blockade in an ambulatory setting. Barriers to the widespread use of peripheral nerve blockade in ambulatory anesthesia could include lack of education and training, and increased anesthetic induction time. Strategies that have demonstrated promise to increase duration of action and attenuate rebound pain phenomenon after peripheral nerve blockade include multimodal analgesia, local anesthetic adjuncts and continuous infusion of local anesthetic. Dexamethasone has been demonstrated to be the most effective local anesthetic adjunct. Continuous peripheral nerve blockade is a reasonable alternative but at the expense of additional costs and logistical reorganization. There is currently insufficient data to promote the ambulatory use of liposomal bupivacaine, cryoanalgesia and percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation. Educational programs and parallel processing may promote peripheral nerve blockade in an ambulatory setting, improving the patient experience in the postoperative period.

Twenty-one patients with pectus excavatum (age range, 13 to 50 years; mean [+/- SD] age, 23.6 +/- 8.9 years; severity index range, 3.7 to 8.0; mean severity index, 5.1 +/- 1.2) were referred for preoperative evaluation. Eighteen of the patients (85%) had a history of performing aerobic activity ranging from 30 min to 2 h per day (mean duration, 1.0 +/- 0.61 h per day) for 3 +/- 1.5 days per week. Patients performed pulmonary function tests, and submaximal and maximal incremental exercise testing. On maximal exercise testing, the maximum oxygen uptake (O(2)max), and oxygen-pulse were significantly lower than the reference values (t(20) = 6.17 [p < 0.0001] and t(20) = 4.52 [p < 0.0001], respectively).

Patients with a PSI of > 4.0 were also eight times more likely to have reduced aerobic capacity than patients who had a low severity index, despite their level of exercise participation. On submaximal testing, we found that the time constant for O(2) uptake kinetics was 37.4 s for the on-transit and 41.6 s for the off-transit. The observed values for FVC, FEV(1), maximum voluntary ventilation, and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide were significantly lower than reference values, but those for total lung capacity and residual volume were not significantly lower than reference values.

Implementation, monitoring and assessment are the responsibilities of the physicians who initiate the program. Fewer postoperative complications, with earlier discharge and rehabilitation, should reduce costs and improve patient management in hospital. Such is, indeed, usually the case, but unfortunately drastic health expenditure curbs greatly attenuate the expected benefit in terms of care organization and cost savings. Copyright © 2019.

This review focuses on research conducted in our laboratory at Ochsner and at other laboratories related to the neurobiology of nerve injury with emphasis on how some of the key findings from animal research help us understand the pathophysiology of poor functional recovery after nerve injury. Published research on the neurobiology of nerve injury and regeneration strongly suggests that chronic Schwann cell denervation, chronic neuronal axotomy, and misdirection of regenerating axons into wrong endoneurial tubes are primarily responsible for poor functional recovery. The effect of muscle denervation atrophy is secondary. Experimental therapeutic strategies (which we are currently investigating in our laboratory at Ochsner) to combat these 3 neurobiologic phenomena have the potential to improve the return of function in patients who have sustained nerve injuries.", "mesh": []}

On the basis of diagnosis codes, included admissions were eligible for 1 of 15 clinical pathways implemented during the study period; admissions from both before and after implementation were included. Postdischarge physical functioning improvement was assessed with the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 4.0 Generic Core or Infant Scales. Average hospitalization costs, length of stay, readmissions, and physical functioning improvement scores were calculated by month relative to pathway implementation. Segmented linear regression was used to evaluate differences in intercept and trend over time before and after pathway implementation. There were 3808 and 2902 admissions in the pre- and postpathway groups, respectively. Compared with prepathway care, postpathway care was associated with a significant halt in rising costs (prepathway vs postpathway slope difference -$155 per month [95% confidence interval -$246 to -$64]; P = .001) and significantly decreased length of stay (prepathway vs post-pathway slope difference -0.03 days per month [95% confidence interval -0.05 to -0.02]; P = .02), without negatively affecting patient physical functioning improvement or readmissions. Implementation of multiple evidence-based, standardized clinical pathways was associated with decreased resource utilization without negatively affecting patient physical functioning improvement.

Children ≤ 18 years who underwent MIRPE with cryoablation between 8/2023 and 1/2024 wore a Fitbit™ for ≥ 3 days preoperatively to determine preoperative PA and through POD 60. The recovery trajectory, defined by postoperative daily step count divided by mean preoperative daily step count, was fit by power function through POD 60 among patients with uncomplicated recovery.

Cryoneurolysis uses exceptionally low temperature to reversibly ablate a peripheral nerve, resulting in temporary analgesia. Where applicable, it offers a unique option given its extended duration of action measured in weeks to months after a single application. Percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation involves inserting an insulated lead through a needle to lie adjacent to a peripheral nerve. Analgesia is produced by introducing electrical current with an external pulse generator. It is a unique regional analgesic in that it does not induce sensory, motor, or proprioception deficits and is cleared for up to 60 days of use. However, both modalities have limited validation when applied to acute pain, and randomized, controlled trials are required to define both benefits and risks.

While extensively studied in adult populations, ERPs in pediatric patients, especially for thyroid surgeries, are uncommon. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing an ERP designed for pediatric patients undergoing single-lobe thyroidectomy. This prospective study was conducted at Nationwide Children's Hospital from January 2023 to December 2024 and involved children 8 years of age or older undergoing single lobe thyroidectomy. Patients with significant comorbid conditions or undergoing total thyroidectomy were excluded. The ERP incorporated standardized preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative care. Outcome measures were postoperative pain, incidence of postoperative nausea, time to discharge, and patient/parent satisfaction. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. 16 patients were included, predominantly female (81.3 %, n = 13), ranging in age from 8 to 17 years. The median surgical time was 63 min (Interquartile Range [IQR]: 56.5, 75). Following surgery, patients spent a median of 60 min (IQR: 43, 63.5) in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and 217 min (IQR: 189, 260) in the transitional care unit (TCU) before discharge. Adherence to the ERP was high, with 100 % compliance to the order set. 81 % of patients experienced no nausea or vomiting in the PACU/TCU. A single patient required an extended stay due to postoperative nausea, for same-day discharge success rate of 93.8 %. Post-discharge, 93.8 % of patients reported no nausea, and pain was effectively managed without opioid use in 68.8 % of patients. There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. No patients required readmission, and all reported high satisfaction with the care received on post-operative satisfaction survey (mean score = 5/5). Implementation of a pediatric ERP for single-lobe thyroidectomy was successful in promoting same-day discharge, effective pain control without opioids, healthcare utilization management, high patient satisfaction. These findings suggest that ERPs can be safely and effectively adapted for select pediatric thyroid surgery, potentially setting a new standard for perioperative care in this population. III.

This review updates a review published in 2014, and previous reviews published in 2011, 2005 and 2000. To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of gabapentin in chronic neuropathic pain in adults. For this update we searched CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from January 2014 to January 2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trials registries. We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing gabapentin (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with participant-reported pain assessment. Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)), or moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on PGIC). We performed a pooled analysis for any substantial or moderate benefit. Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or harmful outcome (NNH). We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created 'Summary of findings' tables. We included four new studies (530 participants), and excluded three previously included studies (126 participants). In all, 37 studies provided information on 5914 participants. Most studies used oral gabapentin or gabapentin encarbil at doses of 1200 mg or more daily in different neuropathic pain conditions, predominantly postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy. Study duration was typically four to 12 weeks. Not all studies reported important outcomes of interest. High risk of bias occurred mainly due to small size (especially in cross-over studies), and handling of data after study withdrawal.In postherpetic neuralgia, more participants (32%) had substantial benefit (at least 50% pain relief or PGIC very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (17%) (RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.1); NNT 6.7 (5.4 to 8.7); 8 studies, 2260 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants (46%) had moderate benefit (at least 30% pain relief or PGIC much or very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (25%) (RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.0); NNT 4.8 (4.1 to 6.0); 8 studies, 2260 participants, moderate-quality evidence).In painful diabetic neuropathy, more participants (38%) had substantial benefit (at least 50% pain relief or PGIC very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (21%) (RR 1.9 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.3); NNT 5.9 (4.6 to 8.3); 6 studies, 1277 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants (52%) had moderate benefit (at least 30% pain relief or PGIC much or very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (37%) (RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.6); NNT 6.6 (4.9 to 9.9); 7 studies, 1439 participants, moderate-quality evidence).For all conditions combined, adverse event withdrawals were more common with gabapentin (11%) than with placebo (8.2%) (RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.7); NNH 30 (20 to 65); 22 studies, 4346 participants, high-quality evidence). Serious adverse events were no more common with gabapentin (3.2%) than with placebo (2.8%) (RR 1.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7); 19 studies, 3948 participants, moderate-quality evidence); there were eight deaths (very low-quality evidence). Participants experiencing at least one adverse event were more common with gabapentin (63%) than with placebo (49%) (RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.4); NNH 7.5 (6.1 to 9.6); 18 studies, 4279 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Individual adverse events occurred significantly more often with gabapentin. Participants taking gabapentin experienced dizziness (19%), somnolence (14%), peripheral oedema (7%), and gait disturbance (14%). Gabapentin at doses of 1800 mg to 3600 mg daily (1200 mg to 3600 mg gabapentin encarbil) can provide good levels of pain relief to some people with postherpetic neuralgia and peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Evidence for other types of neuropathic pain is very limited. The outcome of at least 50% pain intensity reduction is regarded as a useful outcome of treatment by patients, and the achievement of this degree of pain relief is associated with important beneficial effects on sleep interference, fatigue, and depression, as well as quality of life, function, and work. Around 3 or 4 out of 10 participants achieved this degree of pain relief with gabapentin, compared with 1 or 2 out of 10 for placebo. Over half of those treated with gabapentin will not have worthwhile pain relief but may experience adverse events.

The S-LANSS aims to identify pain of predominantly neuropathic origin, as distinct from nociceptive pain, without the need for clinical examination. Two hundred patients with chronic pain were asked to complete the S-LANSS unaided. A researcher then administered the S-LANSS scale and the Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS) in interview format. An independent clinician determined the pain type (neuropathic versus nociceptive) and rated his or her certainty about diagnosis. The S-LANSS scale was also incorporated into a chronic pain questionnaire that was sent to 160 community patients and 150 newly referred patients waiting for pain clinic assessment. The S-LANSS scale correctly identified 75% of pain types when self-completed and 80% when used in interview format. Sensitivity for self-completed S-LANSS scores ranged from 74% to 78%, depending on the cutoff score. There were significant associations between NPS items and total score with S-LANSS score. In the postal survey, completed questionnaires were returned by 57% of patients (n = 174). Internal consistency and convergent validity of the survey S-LANSS scores were confirmed. The findings support the S-LANSS scale as a valid and reliable self-report instrument for identifying neuropathic pain and it is also acceptable for use in postal survey research. Establishing valid measures of symptoms and signs in neuropathic pain will allow standardized comparisons with other investigational measures.

Here, we review our institutional experience in managing recurrent PE to evaluate long-term outcomes and propose an anatomic classification of recurrences, and a decision-making algorithm. Clinical records of patients undergoing repair of recurrent PE (1996-2011) were reviewed. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were employed to examine patient characteristics as potential predictors for re-recurrence. Eighty-five patients with recurrent PE were identified during the study period. The initial operation was a Ravitch procedure in 85% of cases. Revision procedures were most frequently Nuss repairs (N=73, 86%), with remaining cases managed via open approach. Overall cosmetic and functional results were satisfactory in 67 patients (91.8%) managed with Nuss and in 7 (58%) patients managed with other techniques.

One major postoperative complication is the displacement of the implanted metal bar, which is used to remodel the chest wall. Blocking the possible ways that the bar can be displaced with the use of stabilizers and peri/intracostal sutures has reduced the incidence of bar displacement. Despite the modifications, bar dislocation is often reported. We adopted the medial position stabilizer placement method and imposed no postoperative restrictions. In this study, we analyzed the bar dislocation rate with this modification and concurrent postoperative full activity. Nuss procedure modification where stabilizers are placed bilaterally in the medial location was done on patients irrespective of age and Haller index greater than 3.25. A single bar was used for all patients. Cryoanalgesia was performed on every patient. No postoperative restrictions were imposed on the patients. Full immediate activities, including sports, were allowed. 114 patients (103 male, 11 female) were analyzed from 2016 to 2023. The median age was 15 years old. There was zero incidence of bar displacement. The combined incidence of other postoperative complications was 4%: 2 wound infections and 2 hematoma formations, both needing incision and drainage. Bilateral medial stabilizer placement resulted in no incidence of bar dislocation. Return to immediate full activities after the Nuss procedure did not appear to increase the incidence of bar displacement if stabilizers were placed medially. © 2024.

Methods: A porcine model was used in which the application of bilateral cryoanalgesia from intercostal spaces T3-T7 was completed via partial median sternotomy. The animals were kept alive for 7 days and the ribcages were sent to a specialized center for histopathologic analysis of the freezing injury. Results: Forty freezing lesions were completed and analyzed histologically. Thirty-eight (95%) of the cryo-lesions presented 100% nerve fiber degeneration at or distal to the ablation site, with preservation of the perineural connective tissue, as intended. The two unaffected nerves were found to be physically located outside of the freezing area. Conclusions: The complete axonal degeneration with preservation of the perineural tissue opens the possibility to shorter freezing times than the recommended 2 min. Visualization of the nerve and positioning of the probe is important in ensuring the proper effect on the nerve. This histologic analysis confirms the process triggered by cryoanalgesia that, until now, had only been assumed.", "mesh": []}

Postoperative mean and maximum pain scores, opioid (morphine equivalents) use and side effects, and hospital length of stay (LOS) were compared between groups. Patients who received SHT reported lower mean (P = .0047) and maximum (P = .0028) pain scores and used less morphine equivalents/hour over time (P = .046) compared to patients who did not receive SHT. Patients who received thoracic epidural analgesia reported lower mean (P = .0092) and maximum (P = .0083) postoperative pain scores and used more morphine equivalents/hour (P = .01) compared to those who received CILA. In addition, patients who received SHT and CILA had shorter LOS (P = .0013) than patients who received thoracic epidural analgesia without SHT.

The morphology and function of the frozen nerves were examined with light microscopy (hematoxylin and eosinophilin stain and a histochemical thiocholine method) and electron microscopy. The function of the nerve after freezing was assessed using short latency somatosensory evoked potentials, sensory conduction velocity, and electromyogram at various intervals after freezing. There were no changes in morphology or function of nerves cryolesioned at -20 degrees C. The nerve fibers cryolesioned at -60 degrees C showed signs of freezing degeneration and lost their conductive function although, these nerves all recovered. Approximately half of nerve fibers cryolesioned at -100 degrees C showed Wallerian degeneration, and although the time to remyelination was delayed, nerve regeneration was still complete. At -140 degrees C and -180 degrees C the nerve fibers showed immediate necrosis, with destruction of basal membranes and proliferation of collagen fibers. The results explained the mechanism of cryoanalgesia. Our study demonstrates that cryo-temperatures lower than -140 degrees C will cause permanent alterations in nerve morphology and function, whereas warmer temperatures do not result in permanent nerve damage and are therefore not likely to provide long-term analgesia to patients.", "mesh": ["Analgesia", "Animals", "Cryotherapy", "Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory", "Nerve Regeneration", "Neural Conduction", "Rabbits", "Random Allocation", "Reaction Time", "Sciatic Nerve"]}

The mechanisms that disambiguate these mixed and paradoxical symptoms are unknown. Here we longitudinally and non-invasively imaged genetically labelled populations of fibres that sense noxious stimuli (nociceptors) and gentle touch (low-threshold afferents) peripherally in the skin for longer than 10 months after nerve injury, while simultaneously tracking pain-related behaviour in the same mice. Fully denervated areas of skin initially lost sensation, gradually recovered normal sensitivity and developed marked allodynia and aversion to gentle touch several months after injury. This reinnervation-induced neuropathic pain involved nociceptors that sprouted into denervated territories precisely reproducing the initial pattern of innervation, were guided by blood vessels and showed irregular terminal connectivity in the skin and lowered activation thresholds mimicking low-threshold afferents. By contrast, low-threshold afferents-which normally mediate touch sensation as well as allodynia in intact nerve territories after injury4-7-did not reinnervate, leading to an aberrant innervation of tactile end organs such as Meissner corpuscles with nociceptors alone. Genetic ablation of nociceptors fully abrogated reinnervation allodynia. Our results thus reveal the emergence of a form of chronic neuropathic pain that is driven by structural plasticity, abnormal terminal connectivity and malfunction of nociceptors during reinnervation, and provide a mechanistic framework for the paradoxical sensory manifestations that are observed clinically and can impose a heavy burden on patients. © 2022.

Wearable accelerometers objectively measure sleep patterns in children. We aimed to quantify sleep loss associated with patient reported pain scores after a Modified Nuss operation. Ten patients undergoing Modified Nuss operations were recruited during their inpatient stay. Children wore an Actigraph GT3X-BT accelerometer postoperatively during their hospital stay. Hourly sleep minutes were recorded using the Actigraph between 10 pm and 6 am. Patient reported pain scores were abstracted from patient charts. Mixed linear regression models, adjusting for within-subject random effects, were estimated to quantify the association between hourly sleep minutes and patient reported pain scores. Patients were 30% female, with an average age of 15.7 years (range 13-22). The majority (70%) of patients were white non-Hispanic. All patients received a patient controlled analgesic pump. Average postoperative length of stay was 4.8 days (range 4.0-6.0; SD = 0.8). A total of 240 sleep hours and associated pain scores were analyzed. Patients slept on average 48 min per hour. Mixed model analysis predicted that a 1-point increase in pain score was associated with 2.5 min per hour less sleep time. Increases in patient-reported pain scores are associated with sleep loss after a Modified Nuss operation. Objectively quantifying sleep loss associated with postoperative pain using accelerometer data may help clinicians better understand their patient's level of pain control.

Pectus excavatum can be broadly divided into two categories: symmetric or asymmetric morphology. To optimize surgical outcomes of asymmetric pectus excavatum repair, previous work has proposed morphology-tailored bar shaping technique; the bar to be inserted is shaped asymmetrically to counter-balance the outer contour of the chest prior to the passage of the introducer across the chest. We describe an alternate approach that emphasizes precise introducer chest insertion and extraction and that highlights the direction of the introducer passage is from the higher asymmetric side to the lower contralateral side. The shape of the bar is determined after the introducer has been placed into the chest. This technique allows simultaneous compression of the higher asymmetric chest and elevation of the contralateral depressed side by the metal bar achieving excellent symmetric chest appearance.

Among 40 patients who underwent minimally invasive repair for PC deformity from July 2008 to March 2011, 35 patients accepted to answer the QoL questionnaires, and 30 of them who had completed the postoperative 6th month were evaluated in this study. The modified two-step Nuss questionnaire was used for the QoL assessment. All patients and their parents completed the appropriate questionnaires regarding the patients' preoperative psychosocial and physical functioning, and they were asked to answer the same questions on the postoperative 6th month. The results from these questionnaires were analysed using Wilcoxon signed rank test to investigate the effects of the minimally invasive repair of PC deformity on psychosocial and physical functioning of the patients. The questionnaires used in the study confirmed the positive impact of the surgical correction on psychosocial and physical well-being in the patients and their parents. Spearman's ρ correlation coefficient determined how well the answers to the same question at two different times correlated with each other, and Cronbach's alpha demonstrated the internal consistency of these answers. These two parameters showed that the statistical results of the study were reliable enough. Statistical analysis of the scoring of the individual questions and the total scoring of individual patients revealed a statistically significant improvement (P < 0.05) following surgery. Similar significant improvements were observed in the total scoring of individual parents and in most scoring of the individual questions (10 of 13, 77%) in the parental questionnaire (P < 0.05).

The primary outcome was total oral morphine equivalent consumption during hospitalization, at discharge, and 90 d postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included pain scores and pulmonary function measured on postoperative days 1 and 3, at discharge, and postoperative complications. Planned subgroup analysis by opioid exposure and surgical approach was performed. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test demonstrated significantly less inpatient opioid use for cryoanalgesia patients (45 versus 305 mg, P < 0.001), regardless of opioid history (naïve: 22.5 versus 209.8 mg, P < 0.001; tolerant: 159.5 versus 1043 mg, P < 0.001) and minimally invasive approach (opioid naïve: 26.2 versus 209.8 mg, P < 0.001; tolerant: 158.5 versus 1059 mg, P < 0.001).

Children ≤18 years who underwent SCOPE from 2020 to 2022 were retrospectively identified. Preoperative CT within 3 months of procedure was reviewed by 2 radiologists and 1 surgeon. Skeletal maturity was determined by Schmeling-Kellinghaus classification which stages secondary epiphyseal ossification of the medial clavicle. Inter-rater reliability was evaluated. Schmeling-Kellinghaus stage and postoperative pain were compared. Of twenty-eight records reviewed, 57% were Schmeling-Kellinghaus stage 1. High inter-rater reliability was identified (inter-radiologist: kappa = .95, P < .001, all raters: kappa = .78, P < .001). Median age at operation was 15.5 years (interquartile range: 14.8-16.0) and increased with skeletal maturity (P < .001). When comparing stage 1 (n = 16) to >1 (n = 12), stage 1 had lower maximum pain scores (P < .001), total morphine equivalents (P < .001), and benzodiazepine use (P < .001) after surgery. The Schmeling-Kellinghaus classification system is a valid proxy of skeletal maturity that can be applied with high inter-rater reliability. SCOPE during stage 1 was found to have less postoperative pain and narcotic use than more mature stages. This is proof of concept that skeletal maturity should be considered when determining optimal timing of surgical correction. Future research will evaluate the impact of skeletal maturity on postoperative outcomes.", "mesh": ["Child", "Humans", "Funnel Chest", "Retrospective Studies", "Clavicle", "Osteogenesis", "Reproducibility of Results", "Pain, Postoperative"]}

There is novel evidence that ultrasound-guided percutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation (pPNS) may serve as an alternative approach free of the limitations associated with peripheral nerve blocks.

Acute pain occurs irrespective of age and has a prevalence of about 5% of the general population. Surgical procedures and painful diagnostic procedures are the main causes of this unpleasant and dangerous phenomenon for hospitalized children. It should be remembered that maintaining homeostasis in a child undergoing surgery is also affected by provision of an adequate level of analgesia and sedation as well as nerve conduction block within the surgical site. Even though both paediatric anaesthesiologists and paediatric surgeons know that the therapeutic activities during the perioperative period should be focused on ensuring sufficient analgesia and haemodynamic stability in surgical patients, as many as 70% of children undergoing surgery may experience moderate to severe pain [1-7]. Moreover, pain management is one of the fundamental human rights, i.e. the right to relief of suffering. According to the declaration of the 13th World Congress on Pain in Montreal (September 2010), this right also includes children [8, 9]. In Poland, the law was amended in 2017, and now each patient is guaranteed the right to relief and treatment of pain (Journal of Laws of 2017, item 836). Unfortunately, this right is not always respected in paediatric patients. Many factors contribute to ineffective analgesia in paediatric patients, mainly insufficient knowledge and lack of experience (concerning the use of opioids in particular), as well as lack of management standards, the negative attitude of the personnel or poor organization [10-13]. In hospitals which, as a result of organizational changes, have implemented analgesic treatment regimens and regularly educate their personnel in these issues, both efficiency and effectiveness of pain relief in children are high [14]. For many years, Polish paediatric anaesthesio-logists have been promoting and streamlining the analgesic management of children, which has led to the development of the present publication. The regimens presented in it are based on both the latest medical reports and many years of the authors' experience. The classes of recommendations and levels of evidence have been prepared (Tables 1 and 2, respectively). The presented recommendations were formulated based on a survey of medical reports published in the last two decades.", "mesh": ["Acute Pain", "Analgesia", "Analgesics", "Anesthesiology", "Child", "Humans", "Poland"]}

Current non-operative treatment options have only moderate effects and often patients experience persistent pain or side-effects. Novel advances in the field of cryoneurolysis applies low temperatures to disrupt nerve signaling at the painful area, providing pain relief. The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate if cryoneurolysis is superior to sham at decreasing pain intensity 2 weeks after the intervention in patients with knee OA. Secondary aims are to explore effects on pain, quality of life and functional performance over 24 months. This two-arm, parallel-group RCT, approved by the Regional Ethics Committee, will randomly allocate patients (n = 94) to a cryoneurolysis intervention group + standardized education and exercise (CRYO) or a sham group + standardized education and exercise (SHAM) (1:1 ratio). Both groups will be assessed at baseline, 2 weeks post intervention, post education and exercise and at 6, 12 and 24 months after cryoneurolysis. The primary outcome is the NRS knee pain intensity score assessed 2 weeks post the intervention. Secondary outcome measures include functional performance (chair-stand test, 40 m walk, stair test and maximum voluntary contraction of the knee), patient reported outcomes (quality of life (EQ5D), Knee and osteoarthritis outcome scores (KOOS), among others), use of analgesics, and adverse events over 24 months. Cryoneurolysis could potentially provide an effective, safe and non-pharmacological therapeutic option to treat pain in OA patients.

A total of 4,185 patients were studied, including 2,059 during the prospective phase of the study and 2,126 during the retrospective phase. After thoracic epidural catheterization, all patients received general anesthesia. Patients' neurologic status was assessed by an anesthesiologist using clinical criteria after operation and after epidural catheter removal. If neurologic complications were suspected, a neurologist was consulted. The incidence of specific complications was compared for different thoracic puncture sites: upper (T3/4-6/7), mid (T7/8-8/9), and lower (T9/10-11/12) catheter insertion levels. The overall incidence of complications after thoracic epidural catheterization was 3.1% (n = 128).

Eleven North American children's hospitals participated. From 2001 to 2006, 264 patients and 291 parents completed the initial questionnaire, and 247 patients and 274 parents completed the postoperative questionnaire. Responses used a Likert-type scale of 1 to 4, reflecting the extent or frequency of a particular experience, with higher values conveying less-desirable experience. Preoperative psychosocial functioning was unrelated to objective pectus excavatum severity (computed tomographic index). Patients and their parents reported significant positive postoperative changes. Improvements occurred in both physical and psychosocial functioning, including less social self-consciousness and a more-favorable body image. For children, the body image component improved from 2.30+/-0.62 (mean+/-SD) to 1.40+/-0.42 after surgery and the physical difficulties component improved from 2.11+/-0.82 to 1.37+/-0.44.

We hypothesized that development and utilization of standard work for inpatient care of DKA would lead to reduction in hypokalemia and improvement in outcome measures. Development involved systematic review of published literature by a multidisciplinary team. Implementation included multidisciplinary feedback, hospital-wide education, daily team huddles, and development of computer decision support and electronic order sets. Pathway-based order sets forced clinical pathway adherence; yet, variations in care persisted, requiring ongoing iterative review and pathway tool adjustment. Quality improvement measures have identified barriers and informed subsequent adjustments to interventions. We compared 281 patients treated postimplementation with 172 treated preimplementation. Our most notable findings included the following: (1) monitoring of serum potassium concentrations identified unanticipated hypokalemia episodes, not recognized before standard work implementation, and earlier addition of potassium to fluids resulted in a notable reduction in hypokalemia; (2) improvements in insulin infusion management were associated with reduced duration of ICU stay; and (3) with overall improved DKA management and education, cerebral edema occurrence and bicarbonate use were reduced. We continue to convene quarterly meetings, review cases, and process ongoing issues with system-based elements of implementing the recommendations. Our multidisciplinary development and implementation of an evidence-based pathway for DKA have led to overall improvements in care.

However, morbidity rate varies widely among institutions, and the incidence of major complications remains unknown. The American College of Surgeons 2012 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (NSQIP-P) participant user file was utilized to identify patients who underwent MIRPE at 50 participant institutions. Outcomes of interest were overall 30-day morbidity, hospital readmission, and reoperation. Chest wall repair designated MIRPE accounted for 0.6% (n = 264) of all surgical cases included in the NSQIP-P database in 2012. The median age at surgical repair was 15.2 years. Thoracoscopy was used in 83.7% of cases. No mediastinal injuries or perioperative blood transfusions were identified. The 30-day readmission rate was 3.8%. Three patients (1.1%) required re-operation due to the following complications: superficial site infection, bar displacement and pneumothorax. The overall morbidity was 3.8% with no incidences of mortality. This analysis of a large prospective multicenter dataset demonstrates that major complications following MIRPE are uncommon in contemporary practice. Wound infection is the most common complication and the main cause of hospital readmission. Targeted quality improvement initiative should be focused on perioperative strategy to further reduce wound occurrences and hospital readmission.", "mesh": ["Adolescent", "Child", "Child, Preschool", "Female", "Funnel Chest", "Hospitals, Pediatric", "Humans", "Infant", "Male", "Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures", "Patient Readmission", "Postoperative Complications", "Prospective Studies", "Quality Assurance, Health Care", "Plastic Surgery Procedures", "Reoperation", "Retrospective Studies", "Societies, Medical", "Thoracoscopy", "United States"]}

Bar displacement or rotation remains the most common complication of this repair requiring return to the operating room. Retrospective review of all patients at a single institution who underwent repair of pectus excavatum using FiberWire for bar stabilization between December 2009 and March 2013 was undertaken. 93 patients underwent minimally invasive pectus repair using FiberWire during the study period. The patients included 73 males and 20 females, with an average age of 14.6years (range 7-21years). Mean operative time was 102minutes (range 56-198minutes). No patients developed wound complications, two patients developed pain because of bar migration and required return to the OR, and no patients had recurrence of their pectus defect because of bar migration during the study period. Median length of follow-up was 17months (range 3-36months). Stabilization of pectus bars using circumferential rib fixation with FiberWire at multiple points on both sides of the bar appears to be effective in preventing bar rotation and displacement, and requires minimal change to the operation as it has been previously described.

Several studies have shown the feasibility and safety of these cryoablation therapies for the treatment of benign breast tumors and small invasive breast cancer. Although the complete response rate of cryoablation for breast cancer is reported to be relatively good, most studies enrolled a small number of patients, and so reliable conclusions could not be drawn. In this review, we introduce the mechanisms of action of cryoablation, and summarize the current literature on the efficacy and safety of cryoablation for breast cancer. Cryoablation also induces an immunomodulatory effect, which is an interesting topic of research in the era of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Cryoablation for primary tumor may enhance the treatment effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with breast cancer.

A total of 46 pectus excavatum patients for whom the Nuss procedure was conducted were included in the study. The patients were categorized into two groups, depending on whether or not the supplementary maneuver of scoring deformed cartilages was performed in addition to the Nuss procedure. Patients for whom deformed costal cartilages were scored were categorized as the Scoring Group (n = 24); those who received no such scoring were categorized as the Non-Scoring Group (n = 22). After evaluating the maximum stresses occurring on the thoraces by means of dynamic simulation using finite element analyses, intergroup comparison of the maximum von-Mises stress values was performed. Furthermore, after quantifying postoperative pain as the frequency with which patients injected anesthetics through an epidural pain-control system within 2 postoperative days, the degree of pain was compared between the two groups. The maximum stresses occurring on the thorax were significantly greater for the Non-Scoring Group than for the Scoring Group; injection frequency was also greater for the Non-Scoring Group (average 4.9 times for 2 days) than for the Scoring Group (average 2.5 times for 2 days). High stresses occur due to the performance of the Nuss procedure, causing postoperative pain. The stresses can be reduced by performing supplementary scoring on deformed cartilages. Accordingly, postoperative pain is reduced.

However, even with multi-modal approaches to analgesia, using both local anaesthetic and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), pain is not obliterated, and the challenge of pain mitigation and phasing out of painful husbandry practices remains. It is timely to review and reflect on progress to date in order to strategically focus on the most important challenges, and the avenues which offer the greatest potential to be incorporated into industry practice in a process of continuous improvement. A structured, systematic literature search was carried out, incorporating peer-reviewed scientific literature in the period 2000-2019.

However, little about the recurrence of PE is known. The present study aimed (I) to evaluate the characteristics of chest wall depression during treatment and (II) to present the definition of recurrence of PE, investigate the risk factors for recurrence, and predict the recurrence at one year after bar removal (BR). Consecutive 99 patients who had undergone BR for PE in a single hospital from March 2012 to June 2017 were included in the present study. Severity of PE is presented as a radiographical Haller index (RHI) in the present study. RHI is calculated by the ratio of the transverse diameter to the anteroposterior (AP) diameter at the point of the deepest chest wall depression. Patients with a ≥3.5 RHI value, which simultaneously increased to more than the value of RHI before BR, were considered as demonstrating recurrence in the present study. Follow-up data after BR were collected at subsequent time points (i.e., immediate before and after, one month, sixth months, and one year after BR). All postoperative chest wall changes were analyzed to find out the difference according to the age at the time of the Nuss procedure (NP) [<10 years old (early group; EG) vs. ≥10 years old (late group, LG)]. The mean age of patients was 8.91 (±5.23) years at the age of the NP and the mean duration of bar placement was 28.4 (±5.04) months. Seventy-eight males and 21 females were included. The pectus type was 79 symmetric and 20 asymmetric cases. The mean observation period after BR was 16.47 (±3.74) months. There was a significant correlation between the Haller index using chest CT and simple radiography data (P<0.001). Irrespective of the age groups, there were a significant decrease in RHI values after the NP (both P<0.001). In addition, there were no differences in RHI values between the EG and the LG cohort before the NP and immediately after the NP (P=0.775, P=0.356, respectively). RHI values was significantly decreased in the EG (P=0.040) and increased without a significance in the LG (P=0.330) during bar placement. The chest wall depression progressed for the first six months after BR. However, the chest wall depression did not progress one year after BR. Recurrence occurred in nine cases at one year after BR (four cases in the EG and five cases in LG). The recurrence rate was higher in the LG than in the EG without a significance (P=0.479). Multivariate analysis of the recurrence revealed that only RHI after the NP was identified as an independent risk factor of the recurrence. ROC study also showed that RHI value after the NP had a significant predictable cutoff value for the recurrence [cutoff value of RHI: 2.91, sensitivity: 88.9%, specificity: 90.0%, P<0.001, area: 0.899, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.806-0.993]. The present study shows the characteristics of chest wall depression and the risk factor of the recurrence of PE after BR. The effect of the NP is different according to the patient age at the time of the procedure. Early correction of PE can provide better corrective results because of the existence of a more pliable chest wall, which can be easily and sufficiently elevated by the NP. Sufficient elevation of the depressed chest wall should be ensured during the NP to prevent the recurrence of PE.", "mesh": []}

A major barrier was that definitions of CPSP applied were highly variable. Since that prior review was conducted (n=4 studies in meta-analysis), numerous relevant studies have been published warranting an update. The aims of this current review were to: (1) provide an updated prevalence estimate for pediatric CPSP and (2) examine definitions of pediatric CPSP applied in current research. Prospective, observational studies examining CPSP using a validated self-report pain intensity measure in children were included. 4884 unique publications were screened with 20 articles meeting inclusion criteria. Risk of bias using Quality in Prognostic Study tool ranged from low to high. The pooled prevalence of CPSP among mostly major surgeries was 28.2% (95% CI 21.4% to 36.1%). Subgroup analysis of spinal fusion surgeries identified a prevalence of 31% (95% CI 21.4% to 43.5%). Using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation, the certainty in prevalence estimates was moderate. Studies used a range of valid pain intensity measures to classify CPSP (eg, Numeric Rating Scale), often without pain interference or quality of life measures. The overall prevalence of pediatric CPSP is higher than estimated in the prior review, and quality of studies generally improved though with some heterogeneity. Standardizing the measurement of CPSP will facilitate future efforts to combine and compare data across studies. CRD42022306340. © American Society of Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine 2025.

Nevertheless, relationships between pain scores and other methods of pain assessment, e.g. acceptability of pain or its interference with physical functioning, are not fully established. Our aims were to examine these relationships. A cross-sectional study was conducted on patients who underwent major surgery between January 2008 and August 2013. Using logistic regression, we quantified the relationships between movement-evoked pain scores on the numerical rating scale (NRS-MEP) and three dichotomous dependent variables: patient's opinion on acceptability of pain (PO: acceptable or unacceptable pain); nurses' observation of patient's performance of necessary activities to expedite recovery (NO: good or bad performance); a compound measure judging the presence of the clinically desirable situation of acceptable pain associated with good patients' performance (PONO: present or not). Using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis, NRS cut-off points were determined such that they best discriminate between patients having one versus the other outcome for PO, NO and PONO. 15,394 assessments were obtained in 9,082 patients in the first three postoperative days. Nine percent of the patients had unacceptable pain while having an NRS-MEP of 0-4. An estimated 47% (95%CI = 45%-49%) of patients with an NRS-MEP of 7 described their pain as acceptable on day one. Moreover, 33% (31%-35%) performed all required physical activities, and 22% (21%-24%) combined acceptable pain with appropriate movement. NRS cut-off points for PO, NO and PONO were five, four and four, respectively, but had insufficient discriminatory power.

Three patient cohorts with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS, n = 76), non-specific neck and arm pain (NSNAP, n = 40) and lumbar radicular pain/radiculopathy (LR, n = 26) were included. The CST consisted of 13 tests, each corresponding to a QST parameter and evaluating a broad spectrum of sensory functions using thermal (coins, ice cube, hot test tube) and mechanical (cotton wool, von Frey hairs, tuning fork, toothpicks, thumb and eraser pressure) detection and pain thresholds testing both loss and gain of function. Agreement rate, statistical significance and strength of correlation (phi coefficient) between CST and QST parameters were calculated. Several CST parameters (cold, warm and mechanical detection thresholds as well as cold and pressure pain thresholds) were significantly correlated with QST, with a majority demonstrating >60% agreement rates and moderate to relatively strong correlations. However, agreement varied among cohorts. Gain of function parameters showed stronger agreement in the CTS and LR cohorts, whereas loss of function parameters had better agreement in the NSNAP cohort. Other CST parameters (16 mN von Frey tests, vibration detection, heat and mechanical pain thresholds, wind-up ratio) did not significantly correlate with QST. Some of the tests in the CST could help detect somatosensory dysfunction as determined with QST. Parts of the CST could therefore be used as a low-cost screening tool in a clinical setting. Quantitative sensory testing, albeit considered the gold standard to evaluate somatosensory dysfunction, requires expensive equipment, specialized examiner training and substantial time commitment which challenges its use in a clinical setting. Our study describes a CST as a low-cost and time-efficient alternative. Some of the CST tools (cold, warm, mechanical detection thresholds; pressure pain thresholds) significantly correlated with the respective QST parameters, suggesting that they may be useful in a clinical setting to detect sensory dysfunction. © 2019 The Authors.

During the postoperative period, pain control is one of the top priorities. As a result, multiple techniques for pain control have been developed, including thoracic epidural analgesia, multimodal analgesia (MM), and elastomeric pain pump (EPP) placement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of pain control using EPP as an adjunct to MM after the minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE). Methods: We identified all pediatric patients undergoing MIRPE from June 2017 to July 2018. MM was employed in all patients; some patients additionally received subpleural EPP as adjuncts to postoperative analgesia. We reviewed pain scores, length of stay, opioid use, and complications. Results: During the study period, a total of 62 patients were included. The study cohort was divided into 15 patients undergoing MM alone versus 47 patients undergoing subpleural EPP placement plus MM (EPP + MM). Median pain scores were lower in the EPP + MM group (2.9 versus 4.2, P < .05). There was a significant reduction of total inpatient opioid use in the EPP + MM group (357.6 mg versus 466.9 mg, P = .03). There was no difference in median length of stay or complications. We found no significant difference between subpleural versus subcutaneous placement of the infusion catheters. Conclusion: The use of subpleural EPP as an adjunct to MM is an effective way to reduce pain and opioid use after MIRPE without increased risk of complications.

The umbrella term of \"PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS)\" was agreed upon to encompass both the known and emerging clinical entities associated with somatic PIK3CA mutations including, macrodactyly, FAO, HHML, CLOVES, and related megalencephaly conditions. Key clinical diagnostic features and criteria for testing were proposed, and testing approaches summarized. Preliminary recommendations for a uniform approach to assessment of overgrowth and molecular diagnostic testing were determined. Future areas to address include the surgical management of overgrowth tissue and vascular anomalies, the optimal approach to thrombosis risk, and the testing of potential pharmacologic therapies. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "mesh": ["Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Genetic Association Studies", "Genetic Testing", "Growth Disorders", "Humans", "Phenotype", "Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases", "Syndrome"]}
{"pmid": 32944413, "title": "Surgical Stabilization of Rib Fractures: Indications, Techniques, and Pitfalls.", "abstract": "Rib fractures are a common thoracic injury that is encountered in 20% to 39% of patients with blunt chest trauma and is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality1,2. Traditionally, the majority of patient with rib fractures have been managed nonoperatively. Recently, the utilization of surgical stabilization of rib fractures has increased considerably because the procedure has shown improved outcomes3-5. Surgical stabilization should be considered in cases of multiple bicortically displaced rib fractures, especially in those with a flail chest and/or a concomitant ipsilateral displaced midshaft clavicular fracture or sternal fracture, as such cases may result in thoracic wall instability. For surgical stabilization of rib fractures, we classify rib fractures by location, type of fracture, and degree of displacement after obtaining thin-sliced chest computed tomography (CT) scans. The incision is selected depending on the fracture location, and the surgical technique is chosen relevant to the type of fracture. Single-lung intubation is preferred if there is no severe contralateral pulmonary contusion. We favor performing video-assisted thoracoscopy if possible to control bleeding, evacuate hematomas, repair a lung, and perform cryoablation of the intercostal nerves. A lateral approach is considered to be the main surgical approach because it allows access to the majority of rib fractures. A curvilinear skin incision is made overlying the fractured ribs. Posterior rib fractures are exposed through a vertical incision within the triangle of auscultation, and anterior fractures, through a transverse inframammary incision. The muscle-sparing technique, splitting alongside fibers without transection, should be utilized if possible and supplemented by muscle retraction. For surgical stabilization of rib fractures, we currently prefer precontoured side and rib-specific plates with threaded holes and self-tapping locking screws. Polymer cable cerclage is used to enhance plating of longitudinal fractures, rib fractures near the spine, osteoporotic ribs, and injuries of rib cartilage. The third to eighth ribs are plated most often. Intercostal muscle deficit, if present, is repaired with a xenograft patch. In comminuted rib fractures, the bone gap is bridged with bone graft. Surgical stabilization of rib fractures is recommended within the first 7 days after trauma, preferably within the first 3 days6-8. Nonoperative treatment alternatives include (1) epidural analgesia when not contraindicated because of anticoagulant venous thromboembolism prophylaxis9,10; (2) thoracic paravertebral blockage, e.g., serratus anterior or erector spinae plane nerve block11,12; (3) intercostal nerve block; (4) intravenous or enteral analgesics, e.g., opioids, acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); (5) intrapleural analgesia, e.g., bupivacaine infusion; and (6) multimodal analgesia that incorporates regional techniques, systemic analgesics, and analgesic adjuncts9. Surgical stabilization of rib fractures is a safe and effective method to treat displaced rib fractures. The procedure provides definitive stabilization of fractures, improves pulmonary function, lessens pain medication requirements, prevents deformity formation, and results in reduced morbidity and mortality.

A retrospective chart review was conducted of 303 patients undergoing minimally invasive pectus repair from 1987 through August 2000. Since 1997, a standardized treatment pathway was implemented, and 261 of the 303 patients have been treated on this pathway. Preoperative evaluation included computed tomography (CT) scan, pulmonary function tests (PFT), and cardiac evaluations with electrocardiogram (EKG) and echocardiogram. Indications for operation included at least 2 of the following: progression of the deformity, exercise intolerance or restrictive disease on PFT, Haller CT index greater than 3.2, mitral valve prolapse (MVP), or cardiac compression. Technical and design modifications since 1998 have included routine thoracoscopy, the use of an introducer/dissector for creating the substernal tunnel and elevating the sternum, and routine use of a wired lateral stabilizer to prevent bar displacement. The bar is removed as an outpatient procedure in 2 to 4 years. In 303 patients undergoing minimally invasive pectus repairs, single bars were used in 87% and double in 13%. Lateral stabilizers were applied in 70% of patients and were wired for further stability in 65%. Bar shifts before the use of stabilizers were 15%, which decreased to 6% after stabilizers were placed and 5% with a wired stabilizer. Excellent results were noted in 85% with failure in only 1 patient. Complications included pneumothorax with spontaneous resolution in half of the patients and pericarditis in 7. The minimally invasive technique has evolved into an effective method of pectus excavatum repair. Modifications of the technique have reduced complications.

Chronic pain may develop after any routine surgery, but it can have a far greater incidence after amputation, thoracotomy or mastectomy. The peak noxious barrage due to the neural trauma associated with these operations may be reduced in the perioperative period with the potential to reduce the risk of chronic pain. A systematic review of the evidence for perioperative interventions reducing acute and chronic pain associated with amputation, mastectomy or thoracotomy. Thirty-two randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Gabapentinoids reduced pain after mastectomy, but a single dose was ineffective for thoracotomy patients who had an epidural. Gabapentinoids were ineffective for vascular amputees with pre-existing chronic pain. Venlafaxine was associated with less chronic pain after mastectomy. Intravenous and topical lidocaine and perioperative EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anaesthetic) cream reduced the incidence of chronic pain after mastectomy, whereas local anaesthetic infiltration appeared ineffective. The majority of the trials investigating regional analgesia found it to be beneficial for chronic symptoms. Ketamine and intercostal cryoanalgesia offered no reduction in chronic pain. Total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) reduced the incidence of post-thoracotomy pain in one study, whereas high-dose remifentanil exacerbated chronic pain in another. Appropriate dose regimes of gabapentinoids, antidepressants, local anaesthetics and regional anaesthesia may potentially reduce the severity of both acute and chronic pain for patients. Ketamine was not effective at reducing chronic pain. Intercostal cryoanalgesia was not effective and has the potential to increase the risk of chronic pain. TIVA may be beneficial but the effects of opioids are unclear. © 2014 The Authors.

Life-limiting conditions affecting children are a growing medical concern, requiring a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach to improve quality of life or ensure a dignified end of life. Interventional radiology (IR) plays a critical role in this strategy, similar to its role in adult care. Not only life-limiting conditions pose a challenge in pediatric chronic pain management, but also other benign chronic diseases (e.g., cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic disorders). This review focuses on specific IR strategies for pediatric pain management, including ablation, embolization/chemoembolization, and nerve blocks. It emphasizes the importance of tailored approaches for pediatric patients, considering genetic disorders and oncological diseases, which may require a diverse range of IR treatments.

The Nuss technique for minimally invasive repair of PE involves thoracoscopy-assisted insertion of a bar or plate behind the deformity to displace the sternum anteriorly. Our objective here was to clarify the indications and limitations of the Nuss technique based on a review of 70 patients. A retrospective review of children managed at two centres identified 70 patients who had completed their growth and had their plate removed. Mean age was 13.8 years (range, 6-19 years). The reason for surgery was cosmetic disfigurement in 66 (95%) patients. The original Nuss technique was used in 63 patients, whereas 7 patients required an additional sub-xiphoid approach. Time to implant removal ranged from 8 months to 3 years. The cosmetic outcome was considered satisfactory by the patients in 64 (91%) cases and by the surgeon in 60 (85.7%) cases. Major complications requiring further surgery occurred in 6 (8.5%) patients and consisted of haemothorax (n=2), chest wall sepsis (n=2, including 1 after implant removal), allergy (n=1), and implant displacement (n=1). Early or delayed minor complications occurred in 46 (65%) patients and resolved either spontaneously or after non-surgical therapy. The minimal scarring and reliably good outcomes support the widespread use of the Nuss technique in children and adolescents. Our complication rates (minor, 65%; and major, 8.5%) are consistent with previous publications. In our opinion, contra-indications to thoracoscopic PE correction consist of a history of cardio-thoracic surgery and the finding by computed tomography of a sternum-to-spine distance of less than 5 cm or of sternum rotation greater than 35°. In these situations, we recommend a sub- and retro-xiphoid approach to guide implant insertion or a classic sterno-chondroplasty procedure. Level IV, retrospective descriptive cohort study.

Functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury depends on survival of injured neurons and functional reinnervation of target tissue by regeneration of injured axons and collateral sprouting of uninjured (intact) adjacent axons. The rate of axonal regeneration becomes slower and its extent (density and number of regenerating axons) decreases in aged animals. Aging also impairs terminal sprouting of regenerated axons and collateral sprouting of intact adjacent axons, thus further limiting target reinnervation and its functional recovery. Decreased survival of aged noninjured and injured neurons, limited intrinsic growth potential of neuron, alteration in its responsiveness to stimulatory or inhibitory environmental factors, and changes in the peripheral neural pathways and target tissues are possible reasons for impaired reinnervation after peripheral nerve injury in old age. The review of present data suggests that this impairment is mostly due to the age-related changes in the peripheral neural pathways and target tissues, and not due to the limited intrinsic growth capacity of neurons or their reduced responsiveness to trophic factors. Age-related alterations in the soluble target derived neurotrophic factors, like nerve growth factor, and nonsoluble extracellular matrix components of neural pathways, like laminin, might be important in this respect.", "mesh": ["Aging", "Animals", "Axons", "Cell Survival", "Humans", "Nerve Growth Factors", "Nerve Regeneration", "Neurons", "Peripheral Nerve Injuries", "Peripheral Nerves", "Signal Transduction"]}

Using major databases, a systematic search was performed. Studies comparing the implementation of ERAS or ERAS-like and TD pathways in patients with AIS were identified. Data regarding methodology and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Fourteen studies (n = 2456) were included, comprising 1081 TD and 1375 ERAS or ERAS-like patients. Average age of patients was 14.6 ± 0.4 years. Surgical duration was on average 35.6 min shorter for the ERAS group compared to TD cohort ([2.8, 68.3], p = 0.03), and blood loss was 112.3 milliliters less ([102.4, 122.2], p < 0.00001).

A thoracic epidural was performed by the acute pain service to provide immediate onset analgesia, especially during his stay in the hospital. At the same time, the surgeon performed thoracic intercostal nerve cryoablation, where nerves are frozen to prevent them from sending pain signals to the brain to provide analgesia for the patient even after getting discharged from the hospital. Both were done during a perioperative period. The cryoablations complemented the epidural, and they ensured continuous pain control in this patient.

However, there has been a paucity of research examining the application of ERAS in major pediatric orthopaedic surgeries. This study aims to compare the perioperative complications and length of hospital stay after osteotomies in children with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) between ERAS and traditional non-ERAS group. The ERAS group consisted of 86 patients included in the ERAS program from January 2016 to December 2017. The Control group consisted of 82 DDH patients who received osteotomies from January 2014 to December 2015. Length of hospital stay, physiological function, postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) score, and postoperative complications were compared between the two groups. The mean duration of hospital stay was significantly reduced from 10.0 ± 3.1 in the traditional care group to 6.0 ± 0.8 days in the ERAS(P < 0.001). The average VAS score in the first 3 days was significantly lower in the ERAS group (2.9 ± 0.8) than the traditional non-ERAS group (4.0 ± 0.8) (P < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the frequency of break-out pain (VAS > 4) between two groups (29.5 ± 6.3 times vs.30.6 ± 6.5 times, P = 0.276).

A telematic survey was conducted via the Internet on a representative sample of healthcare professionals involved in the management of paediatric acute pain (specifically anaesthesiologists) in Spain. The survey included 28 questions about their usual clinical practice in the assessment and treatment of acute pain, and also training and organisational aspects in paediatric acute pain. The survey was completed during March 2021 by 150 specialists in anaesthesiology. The respondents widely experienced in the management of acute paediatric pain (mean years of experience: 14.3: SD: 7.8), essentially in acute postoperative pain (97% of cases). Although 80% routinely used validated paediatric acute pain assessment scales, only 2.6% used specific scales adapted for patients with cognitive impairment. Most of the respondents routinely used analgesic drugs such as paracetamol (99%) or metamizole (92%), but only 84% complemented these drugs with a loco-regional blocking technique or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (62%). Furthermore, only 62.7% acknowledged having received specific training in paediatric acute pain, only 45% followed hospital institutional protocols, and a scant 28% did so through paediatric pain units. The survey identified important points for improvement in the training and organisation of acute pain management in Spanish paediatric patients. Copyright © 2024.

Its use in adults has also been described, although it may be associated with increased postoperative morbidity resulting from higher chest wall rigidity. This study aimed to examine the risk of complications after the Nuss procedure in adult patients compared with young patients with pectus excavatum. This single-center retrospective cohort study evaluated all patients who underwent the Nuss procedure between 2006 and 2018. Patients were stratified by age as young (≤24 years old) and adult (>24 years old). The primary end point was the occurrence of perioperative or postoperative complications, subdivided into major (Clavien-Dindo class IIIa or higher) and minor (less severe than Clavien-Dindo class III). Between-group differences were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U and the χ2 test with post hoc analysis. A total of 327 participants were included, 272 in the young group (median age, 16 years; interquartile range [IQR], 15 to 18 years; range, 11 to 24 years) and 55 in the adult group (median age, 32 years; IQR, 27 to 38 years; range, 25 to 47 years). The median Haller index was similar between groups (young, 3.7; IQR, 3.2 to 4.4 vs adult,3.6; IQR, 3.0 to 4.3; P = .44). The median follow-up was 34 and 36 months, respectively. The incidence of major complications was comparable between young and adult participants (P = .43). Minor complications occurred more often among adults (young, 4% vs adult, 11%; P = .002). Chronic postoperative pain was the only minor complication with a significant difference in incidence (young, 1% vs adult, 7%; P = .008). The Nuss procedure is a safe surgical treatment for pectus excavatum in both young and adult patients. The risk of major complications is comparable. However, adults more often have chronic pain.

A systematic search of Medline, Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing methods of pain control in pediatric patients undergoing MIRPE was conducted. Studies were restricted to the English language. After screening 1304 references, 9 randomized control trials (RCTs) enrolling 485 patients were included. The average age was 11.9 years (±3.1). Pain scores were decreased with ropivacaine compared to bupivacaine-based epidurals. In studies comparing ketamine to opioid based patient-controlled anesthesia (PCA) pumps, the results were variable. Intercostal and paravertebral nerve blocks had decreased pain scores in 75% of the studies compared to opioid-based PCA. Opioid consumption was decreased in 50% of the trials assessing ketamine-based infusions and 75% of the studies comparing intercostal and paravertebral nerve blocks. Nausea was decreased in several of the ketamine-based infusion and intercostal and paravertebral nerve block studies.

{"pmid": 33401363, "title": "Implementation of an Enhanced Recovery Pathway for Minimally Invasive Pectus Surgery: A Population-Based Cohort Study Evaluating Short- and Long-Term Outcomes Using eHealth Technology.", "abstract": "Pectus excavatum and pectus carinatum are the most common chest wall deformities. Although minimally invasive correction (minimally invasive repair of pectus, MIRP) has become common practice, it remains associated with severe postoperative pain. Preoperative psychosocial factors such as anxiety and low self-esteem can increase postsurgical pain. Early detection of psychological symptoms, effective biopsychosocial perioperative management of patients, and prevention of pain chronification using an enhanced recovery pathway (ERP) may improve outcomes. However, the incidence of the latter is poorly described in adolescents undergoing MIRP. The objective of our study was to evaluate the implementation of an ERP containing early recovery goals and to assess persistent postsurgical pain 3 months postoperatively in pediatric patients undergoing MIRP. The ERP consists of a Web-based platform containing psychological screening questionnaires and extensive telemonitoring for follow-up of patients at home. A population-based cohort study was conducted with prospectively collected data from patients undergoing pectus surgery between June 2017 and December 2017. An ERP was initiated preoperatively; it included patient education, electronic health-based psychological screening, multimodal pre-emptive analgesia, nausea prophylaxis as well as early Foley catheter removal and respiratory exercises. After hospital discharge, patients were followed up to 10 weeks using a Web-based diary evaluating pain and sleep quality, while their rehabilitation progress was monitored via Bluetooth-connected telemonitoring devices. We enrolled 29 adolescents using the developed ERP. Pre-emptive multimodal analgesia pain rating scores were low at hospital admission. Optimal epidural placement, defined by T8-9 or T9-10, occurred in 90% (26/29) of the participants; thus, no motor block or Horner syndrome occurred. Mean bladder catheterization duration was 3.41 (SD 1.50) days in ERP patients. Numeric rating scale (NRS) scores for pain and the incidence of nausea were low, contributing to a fluent rehabilitation. Mean NRS scores were 2.58 (SD 1.77) on postoperative day (POD) 1, 2.48 (SD 1.66) on POD 2, and 3.14 (SD 1.98) on POD 3 in ERP-treated patients. Telemonitoring at home was feasible in adolescents after hospital discharge despite adherence difficulties. Although the pain scores at the final interview were low (0.81 [SD 1.33]), 33% (9/27) long-term follow-up ERP patients still experienced frequent disturbing thoracic pain, requiring analgesic administration, school absenteeism, and multiple doctor (re)visits. Allocating patients to the appropriate level of care preoperatively and immediately postoperatively may improve long-term outcome variables. Internet-based technologies and feasible, objective monitoring tools can help clinicians screen surgical patients for risk factors and initiate early treatment when indicated. Future research should focus on improving risk stratification and include a psychological assessment and evaluation of the effect of perioperative care pathways in children undergoing major surgery.

The guidelines are established by an international panel of experts under the auspices of the American Society of Enhanced Recovery and Society for Ambulatory Anesthesia based on a comprehensive search and review of literature up to September 2019. The guidelines provide recommendation on identifying high-risk patients, managing baseline PONV risks, choices for prophylaxis, and rescue treatment of PONV as well as recommendations for the institutional implementation of a PONV protocol. In addition, the current guidelines focus on the evidence for newer drugs (eg, second-generation 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 [5-HT3] receptor antagonists, neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists, and dopamine antagonists), discussion regarding the use of general multimodal PONV prophylaxis, and PONV management as part of enhanced recovery pathways. This set of guidelines have been endorsed by 23 professional societies and organizations from different disciplines (Appendix 1).Guidelines currently available include the 3 iterations of the consensus guideline we previously published, which was last updated 6 years ago; a guideline published by American Society of Health System Pharmacists in 1999; a brief discussion on PONV management as part of a comprehensive postoperative care guidelines; focused guidelines published by the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, the Association of Paediatric Anaesthetists of Great Britain & Ireland and the Association of Perianesthesia Nursing; and several guidelines published in other languages.The current guideline was developed to provide perioperative practitioners with a comprehensive and up-to-date, evidence-based guidance on the risk stratification, prevention, and treatment of PONV in both adults and children. The guideline also provides guidance on the management of PONV within enhanced recovery pathways.The previous consensus guideline was published 6 years ago with a literature search updated to October 2011. Several guidelines, which have been published since, are either limited to a specific populations or do not address all aspects of PONV management. The current guideline was developed based on a systematic review of the literature published up through September 2019. This includes recent studies of newer pharmacological agents such as the second-generation 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists, a dopamine antagonist, neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonists as well as several novel combination therapies.

We conducted a retrospective review and a mailed survey (quality of life assessment). Associations with reoperation due to bar migration and recurrence after bar removal were evaluated with logistic regression. Three hundred and thirteen patients (79% male) underwent MIRPE at a mean ± SD age of 15 ± 3 years. Bar migration requiring reoperation occurred in 16 (5%) patients (median 26 days, interquartile range 15 to 70 days from repair). Wire fixation (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.16; p = 0.014) and bar stabilizer (HR = 4.57; p = 0.002) use were associated with increased risk of reoperation, and bilateral pericostal suture fixation (HR = 0.15; p < 0.001) and thoracoscopic assistance (78%, HR = 0.23; p < 0.001) were associated with decreased risks. Reoperations rates varied (6% to 26%) during the first 50 cases of each surgeon (n = 6), falling to ≤2% afterward. Of the 101 (32%) patients who have had their bars removed electively, 10 (10%) have required reoperation for recurrence. Patients with a recurrence after bar removal were younger (14.1 ± 3.9 years vs 18.4 ± 3.7 years; p = 0.007) and had their bars removed earlier (2.4 ± 1.2 years vs 3.8 ± 2.1 years; p = 0.036). Of survey respondents (n = 145 [47%]), most (99%) were either very happy (n = 79) or mostly happy (n = 63) with their outcomes. Although excellent outcomes after MIRPE can be achieved, our results highlight identified strategies that are associated with decreased risk of reoperation (eg, use of bilateral pericostal suture fixation, surgeon experience, and thoracoscopic guidance). Our results also suggest that elective bar removal should be delayed until the patient is at least 18 years old and has had the bar in for at least 4 years.

Pain experience is a known risk factor for the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms, though there are little data on its relationship with long-term psychological outcomes following major surgery in pediatric patients. In this study, we examined the relationship between immediate postoperative pain and psychological outcomes at 2 weeks and three months after discharge in a cohort of pediatric patients who underwent MIRPE. We sought to determine whether immediate postoperative pain levels were associated with ongoing distress related to aspects of surgery at both time points. We were also interested in how psychological symptoms related to persistent pain concerns. Data on patients undergoing MIRPE across 14 institutions were collected as part of the Society for Pediatric Anesthesia Improvement Network (SPAIN). Patients were contacted at 2 weeks and three months following discharge to track pain levels and assess psychological distress using a self-report questionnaire. Patients were grouped into cohorts based on self-report of distress related to aspects of surgery, nonsurgical distress, or absence of distress. Analysis revealed that a higher proportion of children reporting ongoing distress related to surgery at both 2 weeks and 3 months experienced higher immediate postoperative pain levels. A subset of patients with complete data sets for 2 weeks and 3 months (N = 76) was further examined. Among the 47 patients who endorsed surgical distress at 2 weeks, 25 (53.2%) continued to endorse surgical distress at 3 months. Additionally, report of surgical distress at 3 months was associated with longer-term postoperative pain. Our data suggest that, in patients undergoing MIRPE, the presence of distress at 2 weeks and 3 months may be associated with higher immediate postoperative pain levels. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.", "mesh": ["Anesthesia", "Child", "Funnel Chest", "Humans", "Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures", "Pain, Postoperative"]}

Recent publications have employed more liberal fasting regimes with no evidence of increased aspiration or regurgitation rates. In this first solely paediatric European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (ESAIC) pre-operative fasting guideline, we aim to present aggregated and evidence-based summary recommendations to assist clinicians, healthcare providers, patients and parents. We identified six main topics for the literature search: studies comparing liberal with conservative regimens; impact of food composition; impact of comorbidity; the use of gastric ultrasound as a clinical tool; validation of gastric ultrasound for gastric content and gastric emptying studies; and early postoperative feeding. The literature search was performed by a professional librarian in collaboration with the ESAIC task force. Recommendations for reducing clear fluid fasting to 1 h, reducing breast milk fasting to 3 h, and allowing early postoperative feeding were the main results, with GRADE 1C or 1B evidence. The available evidence suggests that gastric ultrasound may be useful for clinical decision-making, and that allowing a 'light breakfast' may be well tolerated if the intake is well controlled. More research is needed in these areas as well as evaluation of how specific patient or treatment-related factors influence gastric emptying.

In this prospective, randomized and double-blinded trial and the short and long-term outcomes were compared in patients after surgery. The children were randomized to either the intercostal or control group. Ultrasound-guided intercostal nerve block was with 0.25% ropivacaine and 5 mg dexamethasone in the intercostal group, while the control group was with 0.9% normal saline. The block was performed in the intercostal space corresponding to the lowest depression of the sternum and repeated bilaterally in the spaces above and below. Postoperatively, the children in the two-groups received PCIA with fentanyl for 48 hours. The primary outcome was a pain score on the postoperative day 1, as measured by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Sixty children undergoing the Nuss procedure were enrolled in the trial. The mean differences in VAS scores between the two groups were 3.2 in the PACU (p < 0.001), 1.7 on postoperative day 1 (p < 0.001) and 0.7 on postoperative day 2 (p=0.015). The opioid consumption was significantly lower in the intercostal group during the postoperative 48 hours (p < 0.05). The anxiety and QOL scores in the intercostal group were significantly improved on some points of time (p < 0.05). The incidence of adverse events was markedly lower in the intercostal group during the postoperative 48 hours (p < 0.05).

We used logistic regression analysis to test the correlation between 83 non-AED/patient related potential predictor variables and the rate of PBSE. We then compared for each AED the rate of PBSEs and the rate of PBSEs that led to intolerability (IPBSE) while controlling for non-AED predictors of PBSEs. 922 patients (≤18 years old) were included in our study. PBSEs and IPBSEs occurred in 13.8% and 11.2% of patients, respectively. Overall, a history of psychiatric condition, absence seizures, intractable epilepsy, and frontal lobe epilepsy were significantly associated with increased PBSE rates. Levetiracetam (LEV) had the greatest PBSE rate (16.2%). This was significantly higher compared to other AEDs. LEV was also significantly associated with a high rate of IPBSEs (13.4%) and dose-decrease rates due to IPBSE (6.7%). Zonisamide (ZNS) was associated with significantly higher cessation rate due to IPBSE (9.1%) compared to other AEDs. Patients with a history of psychiatric condition, absence seizures, intractable epilepsy, or frontal lobe epilepsy are more likely to develop PBSE. PBSEs appear to occur more frequently in adolescent and children patients taking LEV compared to other AEDs. LEV-attributed PBSEs are more likely to be associated with intolerability and subsequent decrease in dose. The rate of ZNS-attributed IPBSEs is more likely to be associated with complete cessation of AED. Copyright © 2017 European Paediatric Neurology Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

From April 2010 to December 2013, we performed 6 cases of PE repair in patients with a history of intrathoracic surgery. The causes of previous operations were congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation in 4 patients and congenital diaphragmatic hernia in 2. The patients' median age was 5 years (range, 4-9 years) and median preoperative pectus severity index was 4.63 (range, 3.42-10.03). Their intraoperative and postoperative courses were reviewed retrospectively. The mean overall operation time was 127.5 ± 17.0 minutes, and the mean operation time for endoscopic pneumolysis was 28.8 ± 12.3 minutes. Intraoperative exploration for pleural adhesion revealed that the endoscopic approach in the previous operation was associated with low pleural adhesion, and the open thoracotomy or laparotomy approach was associated with low to high pleural adhesion. One patient developed a pneumothorax on the first postoperative day. All the other patients had uneventful postoperative courses. All the patients received bar removal 2-3 years after bar insertion. One patient developed atelectasis after bar removal. All the other patients had an uneventful postoperative course. The mean postoperative follow-up time after bar removal was 20.1 ± 14.7 months.

ERAS represent a relatively new paradigm in spine surgery. This multidisciplinary consensus review summarizes the literature and proposes recommendations for the perioperative care of patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgery with an ERAS program. This is a review article. Under the impetus of the ERAS® society, a multidisciplinary guideline development group was constituted by bringing together international experts involved in the practice of ERAS and spine surgery. This group identified 22 ERAS items for lumbar fusion. A systematic search in the English language was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, and cohort studies were included, and the evidence was graded according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Consensus recommendation was reached by the group after a critical appraisal of the literature. Two hundred fifty-six articles were included to develop the consensus statements for 22 ERAS items; one ERAS item (prehabilitation) was excluded from the final summary due to very poor quality and conflicting evidence in lumbar spinal fusion. From these remaining 21 ERAS items, 28 recommendations were included. All recommendations on ERAS protocol items are based on the best available evidence. These included nine preoperative, eleven intraoperative, and six postoperative recommendations. They span topics from preoperative patient education and nutritional evaluation, intraoperative anesthetic and surgical techniques, and postoperative multimodal analgesic strategies. The level of evidence for the use of each recommendation is presented. Based on the best evidence available for each ERAS item within the multidisciplinary perioperative care pathways, the ERAS® Society presents this comprehensive consensus review for perioperative care in lumbar fusion.

This included pneumonia, hospital readmission, deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism, and specific pleural complications (pneumothorax, empyema, or chest tube placement). We compared the results of patients returning home by conventional ground travel with the results of patients using air travel. Surveys were sent to 1833 patients, and 817 responded (44.6% response rate). A total of 96 responders (11.8%) used air travel (median distance, 1783 km; range, 486-9684 km) compared with 278 km (range, 1-2618 km) for the 721 responders (88.2%) using ground travel (P < .0001). Male patients used air travel more than female patients (14.4% vs 9.3%; P = .02). Otherwise, no significant differences were observed between the 2 groups. The median duration of hospitalization was 5 days in both groups using air travel (range, 1-25 days) and ground travel (range, 1-42 days) (P = .83). There was no mortality due to postdismissal travel. The rates of major complication after hospital dismissal for those using air and ground travel were 8.3% and 7.8%, respectively (P = .87). Overall major complications are rare in the immediate posthospital dismissal period after lung resection. Air travel during this period was not associated with any significant increase in risk of complications when compared with conventional ground transportation and seems to be a safe option for patients after chest tube removal.

Pain after mastectomy can be difficult to treat, and the authors hypothesized that the severity of surgically related pain would be lower on postoperative day 2 with the addition of cryoanalgesia compared with patients receiving solely standard-of-care treatment. Preoperatively, participants at one enrolling center received a single injection of ropivacaine, 0.5%, paravertebral nerve block at T3 or T4, and perineural catheter. Participants subsequently underwent an active or sham ultrasound-guided percutaneous cryoneurolysis procedure of the ipsilateral T2 to T5 intercostal nerves in a randomized, patient- and observer-masked fashion. Participants all received a continuous paravertebral block with ropivacaine, 0.2%, until the early morning of discharge (usually postoperative day 2). The primary endpoint was the average pain level measured using a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale the afternoon of postoperative day 2. Participants were followed for 1 yr. On postoperative day 2, participants who had received active cryoneurolysis (n = 31) had a median [interquartile range] pain score of 0 [0 to 1.4] versus 3.0 [2.0 to 5.0] in patients given sham (n = 29): difference -2.5 (97.5% CI, -3.5 to -1.5), P < 0.001.

The question addressed was whether cryoanalgesia improves post-thoracotomy pain and recovery. Twelve articles were identified that provided the best evidence to answer the question. The authors, date, journal, study type, population, main outcome measures and results are tabulated. Reported measures were pain scores, additional opiate requirements, incidence of hypoesthesia and change in lung function. Half of the articles reviewed failed to demonstrate superiority of cryoanalgesia over other pain relief methods; however, additional opiate requirements were reduced in patients receiving cryoanalgesia. Change in lung function postoperatively was equivocal. Cryoanalgesia potentiated the incidence of postoperative neuropathic pain. Further analysis of the source of cryoanalgesia, duration, temperature obtained and extent of blockade revealed numerous discrepancies. Three studies utilized CO2 as the source of cryoanalgesia and four used nitrous oxide, but at differing temperatures and duration. Five studies did not reveal the source of cyroanalgesia. The number of intercostal nerves anaesthetized in each study varied. Seven articles anaesthetized three intercostal nerves, three articles used five intercostal nerves, one article used four intercostal nerves and one used one intercostal nerve at the thoracotomy site. Thoracotomy closure and site of area of chest drain insertion may have a role in postoperative pain; but only one article explained method of closure, and two articles mentioned placement of chest drain through blocked dermatomes. No causal inferences can be made by the above results as they are not directly comparable due to confounding variables between studies.

Recovery is highly variable among peoples. Effective acute pain (AP) management is very important but remains suboptimal what could affect long term outcomes. The review questions the impact of either failure or effectiveness of AP treatments and the choice of analgesic drugs on different long-term outcomes after tissue trauma. Pain control during mobilization is mandatory to reduce the risk of complications which exacerbate and prolong the inflammatory response to trauma, impairing physical recovery. Common analgesic treatments show considerable variability in effectiveness among peoples what argues for an urgent need to develop personalized AP management, that is, finding better responders to common analgesics and targeting challenging patients for more invasive procedures. Optimal multimodal analgesia to spare opioids administration remains a priority as opioids may enhance neuroinflammation, which underlies pain persistence and precipitates neurocognitive decline in frail patients. Finally, recent findings demonstrate that AP treatments which modulate nociceptive and inflammatory pain should be used with caution as drugs which inhibit inflammation like nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and corticoids might interfere with natural recovery processes. Effective and safe AP management is of far greater importance than previously realized. Evidence of suboptimal AP management in many patients and recent reports pointing out the impact of current treatments on long term outcomes argue for further research in the field.

The key pathogenic factor in postoperative morbidity, excluding failures of surgical and anaesthetic technique, is the surgical stress response with subsequent increased demands on organ function. These changes in organ function are thought to be mediated by trauma-induced endocrine metabolic changes and activation of several biological cascade systems (cytokines, complement, arachidonic acid metabolites, nitric oxide, free oxygen radicals, etc). To understand postoperative morbidity it is therefore necessary to understand the pathophysiological role of the various components of the surgical stress response and to determine if modification of such responses may improve surgical outcome. While no single technique or drug regimen has been shown to eliminate postoperative morbidity and mortality, multimodal interventions may lead to a major reduction in the undesirable sequelae of surgical injury with improved recovery and reduction in postoperative morbidity and overall costs.", "mesh": ["Brain Diseases", "Cardiovascular Diseases", "Gastrointestinal Diseases", "Humans", "Hypoxia", "Lung Diseases", "Pain, Postoperative", "Postoperative Complications", "Risk Factors", "Stress, Physiological", "Surgical Procedures, Operative"]}

We performed a cohort study of patients undergoing repair of pectus excavatum between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2019, at children's hospitals using the Pediatric Health Information System database. The main exposures were the pectus excavatum repair volume quartile of the patient's hospital and the pectus excavatum repair volume category of their surgeon. Our primary outcome was surgical complication, identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification, and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes from Pediatric Health Information System. Secondary outcomes included high-cost admission and extended length of stay. In total, 7183 patients with an average age of 15.2 years (SD 2.0), 83% male, 74% non-Hispanic White, 68% no comorbidities, 72% private insurance, and 82% from metro areas were analyzed. Compared with the lowest-volume (≤10 cases/year) quartile of hospitals, patients undergoing repair of pectus excavatum at hospitals in the second (>10-18 cases/year), third (>18-26 cases/year), and fourth (>26 cases/year) volume quartiles had decreased odds of complication of OR 0.52 (CI 0.34-0.82), 0.51 (CI 0.33-0.78), and 0.41 (CI 0.27-0.62), respectively. Patients with pectus excavatum who underwent repair by surgeons in the second (>1-5 cases/year), third (>5-10 cases/year), and fourth (>10 cases/year) volume categories had decreased odds of complication of OR 0.91 (CI 0.68-1.20), OR 0.73 (CI 0.51-1.04), and OR 0.55 (CI 0.39-0.76), respectively, compared with the lowest-volume (≤1 case/year) category of surgeons. Procedure-specific case volume is an important factor when considering providers for elective surgery, even among specialized centers providing comprehensive patient care. Copyright © 2021.

We report potential risk factors and make inferences for prevention of infections. An IRB-approved retrospective chart review was used to evaluate demographic, clinical, surgical, and postoperative variables of patients operated on between 10/1/2005 and 6/30/2013. Those with postoperative infection were evaluated for infection characteristics, management, and outcomes with univariate analyses. Over this 8-year period (2005-2013), 3.5% (30) of 854 patients developed cellulitis or infection, significantly more than 1.5% (13) in our previous report of 863 patients, 1987-2005 (p=.007). The most frequent organism cultured was methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Patients who were given clindamycin preoperatively (5 of 26 patients) had higher infection rates than those who received cefazolin (25 of 828) (19% vs 3%, p<.001). Patients treated with a peri-incisional ON-Q (I-Flow, Kimberly-Clark, Irvine, CA) also had higher infection rates (8.3% vs 2.4%, p<.001). Of the 30 patients who developed an infection, eighteen (60%) with cellulitis or superficial infections did not require surgical treatment or early bar removal. The other twelve patients (40%) with deep hardware infections required an average of 2.2 operations (range 1-6), with 3 (25%) requiring removal of their stabilizer and 3 (25%) requiring early bar removal. None of these three patients experienced recurrence of pectus excavatum at 2 to 4 years of follow-up. Preoperative antibiotic selection and use of ON-Q's may influence infection rates after Nuss repair. Nuss bars could be preserved in 90% of all patients with an infection and even 75% of those with a deep hardware infection. Attempts to retain the bar when an infection occurs may help prevent pectus excavatum recurrence. Level of Evidence=III. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Although utilized in pediatric populations, the sensitivity, specificity and methodology of screening tool delivery have not been compared in children. We evaluated the Self-Report Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-LANSS) in adolescents (10-18 years) referred to a tertiary pediatric pain clinic. History and examination by specialist clinicians and multidisciplinary assessment informed classification of the primary pain type. In a prospective cohort, scores were obtained at interview (S-LANSS interview; n = 161, 70% female), and following substitution of self-reported signs with examination findings in the primary pain region (Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs, LANSS examination). Secondly, we retrospectively retrieved questionnaires self-completed by adolescents at their initial clinic appointment (S-LANSS self-completed; n = 456, 73% female). Thirdly, we explored relationships between patient-reported outcomes and S-LANSS scores. S-LANSS interview scores varied with pain classification, and S-LANSS self-completed scores were similarly highest with neuropathic pain (median [interquartile range]: 18 [11, 21]) and complex regional pain syndrome (21 [14, 24]), variable with musculoskeletal pain (13 [7, 19]) and lowest with visceral pain (6.5 [2, 11.5]) and headache (8.5 [4, 14]). As in adults, the cutpoint score of 12/24 was optimal. Sensitivity was highest with inclusion of examination findings and lowest with self-completion (LANSS examination vs S-LANSS interview vs S-LANSS self-completed: 86.3% vs 80.8% vs 74.7%), but specificity was relatively low (37.8% vs 36.7% vs 48%). High S-LANSS scores in non-neuropathic groups were associated with female sex and high pain catastrophizing. The S-LANSS is a sensitive screening tool for pain with neuropathic features in adolescents, but needs to be interpreted in the context of clinical evaluation (clinicaltrials.gov NCT03312881). PERSPECTIVE: This article reports high sensitivity of the S-LANSS screening tool for identifying pain with neuropathic features in adolescents with moderate-severe chronic pain. However, as sensitivity is lower than in adult populations, further interdisciplinary evaluation is necessary to inform diagnosis and management.

Under the auspices of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG), a consensus process was used to develop evidence-based guidelines for the pharmacologic management of neuropathic pain that take into account clinical efficacy, adverse effects, impact on health-related quality of life, convenience, and costs. On the basis of randomized clinical trials, medications recommended as first-line treatments for neuropathic pain included certain antidepressants (i.e., tricyclic antidepressants and dual reuptake inhibitors of both serotonin and norepinephrine), calcium channel alpha(2)-delta ligands (i.e., gabapentin and pregabalin), and topical lidocaine. Opioid analgesics and tramadol were recommended as second-line treatments that can be considered for first-line use in selected clinical circumstances. Other medications that generally would be used as third-line treatments include certain other antidepressant and antiepileptic medications, topical capsaicin, mexiletine, and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonists. Two other national and international associations recently published pharmacologic treatment guidelines for neuropathic pain, which are summarized and contrasted with the NeuPSIG recommendations. Recent guidelines for the use of neurostimulation for the treatment of neuropathic pain also are summarized.

This definition has become accepted widely by health care professionals and researchers in the pain field and adopted by several professional, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations, including the World Health Organization. In recent years, some in the field have reasoned that advances in our understanding of pain warrant a reevaluation of the definition and have proposed modifications. Therefore, in 2018, the IASP formed a 14-member, multinational Presidential Task Force comprising individuals with broad expertise in clinical and basic science related to pain, to evaluate the current definition and accompanying note and recommend whether they should be retained or changed. This review provides a synopsis of the critical concepts, the analysis of comments from the IASP membership and public, and the committee's final recommendations for revisions to the definition and notes, which were discussed over a 2-year period. The task force ultimately recommended that the definition of pain be revised to \"An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage,\" and that the accompanying notes be updated to a bulleted list that included the etymology.

The erector spinae plane block has become the technique of choice in our institution due to its relative simplicity and purported safety. The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to determine its effectiveness in improving respiratory and analgesic outcomes. We reviewed electronic medical records of patients with traumatic rib fractures admitted to a level-one trauma centre between January 2016 and July 2017, who also received erector spinae plane blocks. We analysed the following outcomes before and up to 72 h after erector spinae plane blockade: incentive spirometry volume; maximum numerical rating scale static pain scores; and 12-h opioid consumption. Pre- and post-block data were compared. We included 79 patients, 77% of whom received continuous erector spinae plane block for a mean (SD) of 3.7 (1.9) days. The majority (85%) had other associated injuries. Incentive spirometry volumes improved from 784 (694) to 1375 (667) ml (p < 0.01) during the first 24 h following erector spinae plane blockade. Pain scores were reduced from 7.7 (2.5) to 4.7 (3.2) in the first three hours (p < 0.01). Reductions in opioid consumption were observed but did not achieve statistical significance. These improvements were largely sustained for up to 72 h. Mean arterial blood pressure remained unchanged from baseline. In conclusion, erector spinae plane blocks were associated with improved inspiratory capacity and analgesic outcomes following rib fracture, without haemodynamic instability.

This study represents an attempt towards exploring the changes in quality of life and overall satisfaction in young male adults who underwent a Nuss procedure. We have included 20 male patients with a median age of 18 years (range: 14-37 years). We have used two specific questionnaires: the two-step Nuss evaluation Questionnaire modified for Adults (NQ-mA) and a new Single Step Questionnaire (SSQ). The data was analysed using Wilcoxon signed rank test to determine statistical significance of differences, with a <0.05 level of significance. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to assess the correlation between the answers. The primary indication for surgery was cosmetic. Both questionnaires were adequate to measure disease-specific quality-of-life changes after surgery and were able to confirm the positive impact of surgery on both the physical and the physiological well-being of young adults. Statistical analysis of the scoring of the individual questions and the total score of individual patients revealed a statistically significant improvement (p<0.05) following surgery. The SSQ had a highly significant correlation to the NQ-mA questionnaire (correlation coefficient=0.682, p=0.001). Overall, the SSQ revealed a statistically significant improvement (p=0.001) in self-esteem and a high level of satisfaction following the Nuss procedure.

Post-operative 24 h morphine consumption, intra-operative fentanyl consumption, time of the first request for analgesia and post-operative visual analogue scale (VAS), heart rate (HR), mean blood pressure (MBP) and complications were recorded. Post-operative 24 h morphine consumption and time of the first request for analgesia were comparable between both groups (P = 0.32 and 0.075, respectively). There was no significant difference in the intra-operative fentanyl consumption. There was also no significant difference in VAS between both groups over the 24 h of study. Four patients in group I developed pneumothorax with no significant differences between both groups (P = 0.114). Incidence of nausea and vomiting was comparable between both groups.

{"pmid": 12632353, "title": "Cardiopulmonary effects of closed repair of pectus excavatum.", "abstract": "Increasing numbers of patients with pectus excavatum defects are presenting for operative repair. Studies that follow-up with patients after open repair have found a decrease in pulmonary function with some improvement in cardiac output and exercise tolerance; however, these effects have not been examined systematically after closed or Nuss repair of pectus excavatum. This study examined the early postoperative effects of closed repair of pectus on pulmonary function, exercise tolerance, and cardiac function. Patients were followed up prospectively after initial evaluation for operation. All patients underwent preoperative computed tomography (CT) scan, and pre- and postoperative (3 months) pulmonary function studies, exercise tolerance, and echocardiographic evaluation of cardiac function. Eleven patients underwent evaluation. Preoperative CT index was 4.1 +/- 0.9. Patients reported an improvement in subjective postoperative exercise tolerance (4.1 +/- 0.7; maximal, + 5). Pulmonary function studies (FVC and vital capacity) were significantly reduced at 3 months postsurgery: change in FVC, -0.67 +/- 0.92 L and VC, -0.5 +/- 0.72 L. Similarly, VO2 max was reduced: preoperative, 35.6 +/- 1.5 versus postoperative, 29.1 +/- 11.9 L/kg/min. Cardiac function was significantly improved postoperation (stroke volume preoperative, 61.6 +/- 25 versus 77.5 +/- 23 mL postoperative). All comparisons had a P value less than.05 by Student's paired t test. These results show that closed repair of pectus excavatum is associated with a subjective improvement in exercise tolerance, which is paralleled by an increase in cardiac function and a decline in pulmonary function. These findings support the use of closed repair of pectus excavatum in patients who complain of subjective shortness of breath; further study is required to delineate the long-term cardiopulmonary implications after closed repair.

In this multicenter study, we describe perioperative multimodal analgesic (MMA) management and characterize postoperative pain, disability, and quality of life over 12 months after PSF in adolescents and young adults. Subjects (8-25 years) undergoing PSF were recruited at 6 sites in the United States between 2016 and 2023. Data were collected on pain, opioid consumption (intravenous morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/kg), and use of nonopioid analgesics through postoperative days (POD) 0 and 1. Pain descriptors, functional disability, and quality of life were assessed preoperatively, 2 to 6 and 10 to 12 months after surgery using questionnaires (PainDETECT, Functional Disability Inventory [FDI], and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory [PedsQL]). Descriptive analyses of analgesic use across and within sites (by preoperative pain and psychological diagnoses), acute postoperative pain and yearly in-hospital analgesic trends are reported. Pain trajectories over 12 months were analyzed using group-based discrete mixture. CPSP (defined as pain score >3/10 beyond 2 months postsurgery), and associated FDI and PedsQL were analyzed. In this cohort (343 patients, median [interquartile range {IQR}] 15.2 (13.7-16.6) years, 71.1% female), perioperative use of opioids and nonopioid analgesics significantly varied across sites (P < .001). Preoperatively, gabapentinoids were administered to 48.2% (157/343). Intraoperatively, opioid use included remifentanil (264/337 [78.3%]) and fentanyl (73/337 [21.7%]) infusions, and methadone boluses (159/338 [47%]). Postoperatively, patient-controlled analgesia was commonly used (342/343 [99.9%]). Within sites MMA use did not appear to differ by preoperative pain or psychological comorbidities. Median in-hospital opioid use declined over time (-0.08 [standard error {SE} 0.02] MME/kg/POD 0 to 1 per year, P < .001) while increased use of ketamine (P < .001), methadone (P < .001), dexmedetomidine (P < .001), and regional analgesia (P = .015) was observed. Time spent in moderate-to-severe pain on POD 0 to 1 was ≈33%. CPSP was reported by 24.2% (64/264) with ~17% reporting ongoing neuropathic/likely neuropathic pain. Four postsurgical pain trajectories were identified; 2 (71%) showed resolving pain and 2 (29%) showed persistent mild and moderate-to-severe pain. Although FDI and PedsQL improved over time in both CPSP and non-CPSP groups (P < .001), FDI was higher (P < .001) and PedsQL lower (P = .001) at each time point in the CPSP versus the non-CPSP group. MMA strategies showed site-specific variability and decreasing yearly trends of in-hospital opioid use without changes in acute or chronic pain after PSF. There was a high incidence of persistent pain associated with disability and poor quality of life warrants postoperative surveillance to enable functional recovery.

Peak oxygen consumption was near normal, although work at VO2max was less than predicted (mean, 68.2% before v. 71.8% after surgery). V(E) was below normal and Vt/FVC was below the expected 50% to 60% level both before and after surgery (41.3% +/- 3 SE and 41.6% +/- 3 SE pre- and postoperatively, respectively).

This study aimed to compare the use of intercostal cryoablation, liposomal bupivacaine (LipoB), and standard therapy on patient-reported pain, opioid administration, and clinical outcomes following BLTx. A retrospective review of all BLTx performed at a single center from January 2016 to December 2023 was performed. Due to varying surgeon preferences, patients received intraoperative cryoablation or LipoB in addition to systemic pain control measures or systemic measures only in the intra- or peri-operative period. Primary outcomes included patient-reported pain and the amount of opioid administration. Secondary outcomes included opioid-related complications and perioperative outcomes. Opioid administration was standardized using morphine milligram equivalents. Opioid levels and pain scores were predicted using a mixed-effects model. Of the 153 patients included, 42.5% (n = 65) received systemic-only, 31.4% (n = 48) received LipoB, and 26.1% (n = 40) received cryoablation. Patients receiving cryoablation reported significantly lower pain through postoperative day 14 (P < .0001). Opioid administration was not different between groups (P = .107). Patients receiving cryoablation had lower rates of postoperative ileus (P = .004) but longer intensive care unit and postoperative length of stay (P < .001). Cryoablation was associated with a clinically significant reduction in patient-reported pain following BLTx. Significantly longer length of stay in the cryoablation group warrants future prospective, randomized investigation. Copyright © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

{"pmid": 15788709, "title": "Respiratory action of the intercostal muscles.", "abstract": "The mechanical advantages of the external and internal intercostals depend partly on the orientation of the muscle but mostly on interspace number and the position of the muscle within each interspace. Thus the external intercostals in the dorsal portion of the rostral interspaces have a large inspiratory mechanical advantage, but this advantage decreases ventrally and caudally such that in the ventral portion of the caudal interspaces, it is reversed into an expiratory mechanical advantage. The internal interosseous intercostals in the caudal interspaces also have a large expiratory mechanical advantage, but this advantage decreases cranially and, for the upper interspaces, ventrally as well. The intercartilaginous portion of the internal intercostals (the so-called parasternal intercostals), therefore, has an inspiratory mechanical advantage, whereas the triangularis sterni has a large expiratory mechanical advantage. These rostrocaudal gradients result from the nonuniform coupling between rib displacement and lung expansion, and the dorsoventral gradients result from the three-dimensional configuration of the rib cage. Such topographic differences in mechanical advantage imply that the functions of the muscles during breathing are largely determined by the topographic distributions of neural drive. The distributions of inspiratory and expiratory activity among the muscles are strikingly similar to the distributions of inspiratory and expiratory mechanical advantages, respectively. As a result, the external intercostals and the parasternal intercostals have an inspiratory function during breathing, whereas the internal interosseous intercostals and the triangularis sterni have an expiratory function.", "mesh": ["Animals", "Humans", "Intercostal Muscles", "Nervous System Physiological Phenomena", "Respiratory Muscles", "Respiratory Physiological Phenomena"]}

This study aims to investigate the prevalence of chronic postappendectomy pain (CPAP) in children and its social and physical effects. This prospective observational study was conducted on children aged 8-18 years who had undergone open appendectomies. In the sixth month after the surgical procedure, the presence of chronic pain was examined in the lower right abdominal area. CPAP and its effects on children's daily life activities were assessed using the numeric rating scale (NRS) and the Pediatric Quality of Life Scale (PedsQL). Analysis was performed on 158 children, 97 of whom were boys (61.4%) and 61 were girls (38.6%). The average age was 12.8 ± 3 years, the average NRS was 4.48 ± 1.1, and the average scar length was 6.09 ± 1.6 cm. Twenty-nine children described CPAP, and its prevalence at six months after the surgery was 18.4%. Of these, 16 (55.2%) complained of pain only during exercise and 13 (44.8%) experienced pain while resting. The rate of CPAP was significantly higher in girls. Female gender and longer scar length were associated with the development of chronic pain. The PedsQL scores from the children's self-reports and their parents' reports were significantly lower for children who described CPAP as compared to those without CPAP. CPAP occurs quite frequently in children, especially in girls, and negatively affects children's quality of life.

Although wide local excision with negative margins is standard, the role of full-thickness chest wall resection (FTCWR) for PTs invading the chest wall remains unclear. This systematic review evaluated the outcomes of FTCWR in such cases, focusing on oncologic effectiveness and reconstruction. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus databases, and Google Scholar (up to the end of November 2024) identified 18 case reports describing 18 patients (mean age of 42.9 years) with locally invasive PTs. Results: Most patients presented with large (>5 cm), recurrent malignant tumors fixed to the chest wall, with the largest measuring 38 cm. Median disease-free survival was 12 months (range: 1-60), with local recurrence in 5.6% and distant metastases in 22.2% of cases. Common complications included respiratory and wound-related issues. Despite the radical surgery, all patients achieved satisfactory cosmetic results. Conclusions: While FTCWR appears feasible and provides symptom relief and short-term disease control in select patients, the evidence remains limited to case reports. Its long-term oncologic benefit is still uncertain, and further research, including prospective studies and multi-center registries, is needed to elucidate its role in clinical practice.", "mesh": []}

Study of Wound Infection and Temperature Group.", "abstract": "Mild perioperative hypothermia, which is common during major surgery, may promote surgical-wound infection by triggering thermoregulatory vasoconstriction, which decreases subcutaneous oxygen tension. Reduced levels of oxygen in tissue impair oxidative killing by neutrophils and decrease the strength of the healing wound by reducing the deposition of collagen. Hypothermia also directly impairs immune function. We tested the hypothesis that hypothermia both increases susceptibility to surgical-wound infection and lengthens hospitalization. Two hundred patients undergoing colorectal surgery were randomly assigned to routine intraoperative thermal care (the hypothermia group) or additional warming (the normothermia group). The patient's anesthetic care was standardized, and they were all given cefamandole and metronidazole. In a double-blind protocol, their wounds were evaluated daily until discharge from the hospital and in the clinic after two weeks; wounds containing culture-positive pus were considered infected. The patients' surgeons remained unaware of the patients' group assignments. The mean (+/- SD) final intraoperative core temperature was 34.7 +/- 0.6 degrees C in the hypothermia group and 36.6 +/- 0.5 degrees C in the normothermia group (P < 0.001) Surgical-wound infections were found in 18 of 96 patients assigned to hypothermia (19 percent) but in only 6 of 104 patients assigned to normothermia (6 percent, P = 0.009). The sutures were removed one day later in the patients assigned to hypothermia than in those assigned to normothermia (P = 0.002), and the duration of hospitalization was prolonged by 2.6 days (approximately 20 percent) in hypothermia group (P = 0.01).

The purpose of this communication is to make surgeons aware of the risk of these life threatening complications as well as the modifications which have been developed to prevent them. Data related to life-threatening complications of Pectus Excavatum (PE) patients was obtained from four sources: 1. A survey of Chest Wall International Group (CWIG) surgeons who specialize in repairing congenital chest wall malformations, 2. Papers and case reports presented at CWIG meetings, 3. Review of medico-legal cases from the USA and 4. A systematic review of the literature related to major complications post MIRPE. From 1998 to 2016, we identified 27 published cases and 32 unreported life-threatening complications including: cardiac perforation, hemothorax, major vessel injury, lung injury, liver injury, gastrointestinal problems, and diaphragm injury. There were seven cases of major complications with bar removal (reported and non-reported) with two lethal outcomes. Mortality data with bar placement surgery: Four published death cases and seven unpublished death cases. The overall incidence of minor & major complications post MIRPE has been reported in the literature to be 2-20%. The true incidence of life-threatening complications and mortality is not known as we do not know the overall number of procedures performed worldwide. However, based on data extrapolated from survey information, the pectus bar manufacturer in the USA, literature reports, and data presented at CWIG meetings as to the number of cases performed we estimated that approximately fifty thousand cases have been performed and that the incidence of life-threatening complications is less than 0.1% with many occurring during the learning curve. Analysis of the cases identified in our survey revealed that previous chest surgery, pectus severity and inexperience were noted to be significant risk factors for mortality. Published reports support the safety and efficacy of MIRPE; however major adverse outcomes are underreported. Although major complications with MIRPE and pectus bar removal surgery are very rare, awareness of the risk and mortality of life-threatening complications is essential to ensure optimal safety. Factors such as operative technique, patient age, pectus severity and asymmetry, previous chest surgery, and the surgeon's experience play a role in the overall incidence of such events. These preventable events can be avoided with proper training, mentoring, and the use of sternal elevation techniques. Treatment Study. Level IV. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Although the literature is limited on the efficacy and safety of cryoneurolysis, there is a consensus that the use of cryoneurolysis is effective, with a risk profile similar to that of other percutaneous procedures. We are reporting the case of a 74-year-old male who underwent cryoneurolysis for chronic right knee pain. Initially, the patient had complete symptomatic improvement, but subsequently developed rigors and right knee swelling, prompting him to seek emergency medical care. Computed tomography angiography was significant for myonecrosis and phlegmon with early abscess formation. The patient continued to improve symptomatically with i.v. antibiotics. He was discharged home on hospital day 8 with a peripherally inserted central catheter. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Cryoneurolysis will likely continue to gain popularity as an option for pain management in osteoarthritis and other degenerative joint diseases.

Quantitative sensory testing identifies specific mechanism-related sensory profiles; brain imaging is a potential biomarker of alterations in central processing and modulation of both sensory and affective components of pain; and genetic analysis can reveal known and new causes of neuropathic pain. Alongside existing patient- and parent-reported outcome measures, somatosensory system research methodologies and validation of mechanism-based standardised end-points may inform individualised therapy and stratification for clinical trials that will improve evidence-based management of neuropathic pain in children.

The Society for Pediatric Anesthesia Improvement Network was established to investigate outcomes for procedures where there is significant management variability. For our first study, we established a multicenter observational database to characterize the analgesic strategies used to manage pediatric patients undergoing MIRPE. Outcome data from the participating centers were used to assess the association between analgesic strategy and pain outcomes. Fourteen institutions enrolled patients from June 2014 through August 2015. Network members agreed to an observational methodology where each institution managed patients based on their institutional standards and protocols. There was no requirement to standardize care. Patients were categorized based on analgesic strategy: epidural catheter (EC), paravertebral catheter (PVC), wound catheter (WC), no regional (NR) analgesia, and intrathecal morphine techniques. Primary outcomes, pain score and opioid consumption by postoperative day (POD), for each technique were compared while adjusting for confounders using multivariable modeling that included 5 covariates: age, sex, number of bars, Haller index, and use of preoperative pain medication. Pain scores were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance with Bonferroni correction. Opioid consumption was analyzed using a multivariable quantile regression. Data were collected on 348 patients and categorized based on primary analgesic strategy: EC (122), PVC (57), WC (41), NR (120), and intrathecal morphine (8). Compared to EC, daily median pain scores were higher in patients managed with PVC (POD 0), WC (POD 0, 1, 2, 3), and NR (POD 0, 1, 2), respectively (P < .001-.024 depending on group). Daily opioid requirements were higher in patients managed with PVC (POD 0, 1), WC (POD 0, 1, 2), and NR (POD 0, 1, 2) when compared to patients managed with EC (P < .001). Our data indicate variation in pain management strategies for patients undergoing MIRPE within our network.

Cryotherapy may be appropriate in patients seeking immediate pain relief for trigeminal neuralgia (TN) near the end of life with its minimal invasiveness and procedural morbidity. While cryosurgery has been effectively demonstrated in the treatment of primary TN, this study is unique as it is the first documented use of CT guidance and treatment of secondary TN using percutaneous cryoablation. To perform and report experience with CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation, a palliative treatment for TN secondary to recurrent invasive head and neck carcinoma, in patients previously treated with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and/or surgery with the goal of improving functional status and quality of life. Palliative cryoablation procedures performed under CT guidance on recurrent head and neck malignancy between September 2010 and June 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia or conscious sedation. For each patient, 1-2 cryoprobes were placed in the tumor and two or four freeze-thaw cycles were performed. Patients were evaluated for facial pain relief immediately after treatment by telephone follow-up. Three patients underwent treatment for three masses using CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation. On imaging, technical success was achieved in all cases with hypodense ice formation encompassing symptomatic lesions on the CT scan. No procedural complications were encountered with post-procedure pain relief and reduction in required pain medication noted in all patients. One patient had 1 month of pain relief before the symptoms returned. CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation is an efficient minimally invasive method for the palliative treatment of TN secondary to recurrent invasive head and neck carcinoma as a result of direct tumoral invasion of the extracranial divisions of the trigeminal nerve. Patients meeting the therapeutic criteria of individuals treated for musculoskeletal metastatic lesions may benefit from this treatment.

Many different techniques have been described, which can be broadly categorised into anteromedial, anterolateral and posterior chest wall blocks. Understanding the relevant clinical anatomy is critical not only for block performance, but also to match block techniques appropriately with surgical procedures. The sensory innervation of tissues deep to the skin (e.g. muscles, ligaments and bone) can be overlooked, but is often a significant source of pain. The primary mechanism of action for these blocks is a conduction blockade of sensory afferents travelling in the targeted fascial planes, as well as of peripheral nociceptors in the surrounding tissues. A systemic action of absorbed local anaesthetic is plausible but unlikely to be a major contributor. The current evidence for their clinical applications indicates that certain chest wall techniques provide significant benefit in breast and thoracic surgery, similar to that provided by thoracic paravertebral blockade. Their role in trauma and cardiac surgery is evolving and holds great potential.

Moderate to severe neuropathic pain requiring intervention develops in 2.2% to 11.9% of patients as a result of ileoinguinal and genitofemoral nerve entrapment. Cryoanalgesic ablation has been successful in treating chronic pain from craniofacial neuralgia, facet joint syndrome, and malignant pain syndromes. We report our experience using cryoanalgesic ablation for chronic ileoinguinal and genitofemoral neuralgia after inguinal herniorrhaphy. Ten patients with ileoinguinal, genitofemoral, or combined neuralgia underwent 12 cryoanalgesic ablations between April 1996 and June 2001. These patients were referred from a multidisciplinary pain clinic, and focused low-volume nerve blocks were used to map nerve involvement preoperatively. After surgical exposure, nerves and surrounding tissues were cooled to ?70 degrees C for 3 min using the Lloyd Neurostat. Patients were seen 2 weeks postoperatively and offered monthly follow-up assessments. Nine men and one woman, ages 20 to 54 (mean, 42.6 years) were treated during 58 months, with a mean follow-up period of 8.2 months, for ileoinguinal (n = 4), genitofemoral (n = 1), and combined (n = 5) neuralgia. Patients reported one to five prior herniorrhaphies (mean, 1.8), experienced neuropathic pain 0 to 14 years (mean, 6.3 years), and underwent up to 3 (mean, 1.3) ablative pain procedures before referral. After cryotherapy, patients reported overall pain reduction of 0% to 100% (mean, 77.5%; median, 100%); 80% reported decreased analgesic use, and 90% reported increased physical capacity. Two patients underwent additional cryotherapy, one for incomplete relief and one for recurrent pain, both with 100% efficacy. Wound infection (n = 1) was the only complication. Cryoanalgesic ablation successfully eliminates ileoinguinal and genitofemoral neuralgia in most patients, and should be considered early in the treatment of patients with postherniorrhaphy neuropathic pain.", "mesh": ["Adult", "Chronic Disease", "Digestive System Surgical Procedures", "Female", "Follow-Up Studies", "Hernia, Inguinal", "Humans", "Hypothermia, Induced", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pain, Postoperative", "Treatment Outcome"]}

Although intraoperative normothermia is an important quality performance measure for patients undergoing colorectal surgery, the effects of intraoperative hypothermia on SSI remain unstudied in trauma. A review of all patients (July 2003-June 2008) who survived 4 days or more after urgent trauma laparotomy at a level I trauma center revealed 524 patients. Patient characteristics, along with preoperative and intraoperative care focusing on SSI risk factors, including the depth and duration of intraoperative hypothermia, were evaluated. The primary outcome measure was the diagnosis of SSI within 30 days of surgery. Cut-point analysis of the entire range of lowest intraoperative temperature measurements established the temperature nadir that best predicted SSI development. Single and multiple variable logistic regression determined SSI predictors. The mean intraoperative temperature nadir of the study population (n = 524) was 35.2°C ± 1.1°C and 30.5% had at least 1 temperature measurement less than 35°C. Patients who developed SSI (36.1%) had a lower mean intraoperative temperature nadir (P = 0.009) and had a greater number of intraoperative temperature measurements <35°C (P < 0.001) than those who did not. Cut-point analysis revealed an intraoperative temperature of 35°C as the nadir temperature most predictive of SSI development. Multivariate analysis determined that a single intraoperative temperature measurement less than 35°C independently increased the site infection risk 221% per degree below 35°C (OR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.24-3.92, P = 0.007). Just as intraoperative hypothermia is an SSI risk factor in patients undergoing elective colorectal procedures, intraoperative hypothermia less than 35°C adversely affects SSI rates after trauma laparotomy.

Two anchors, the Children with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN) Screener and the Clinical Risk Groups (CRGs), were used to identify children with special health-care needs or chronic conditions. We established cutoff scores for the PedsQL's physical, emotional, social, school, and total functioning using the areas under the curves (AUCs) to determine the discriminative property of the PedsQL referring to the anchors. The discriminative property of the PedsQL was superior, especially in total functioning (AUC > 0.7), between children with special health-care needs (based on the CSHCN Screener) and with moderate and major chronic conditions (based on the CRGs) as compared to healthy children. For children <8 years, the recommended cutoff scores for using total functioning to identify CSHCN were 83, 79 for moderate, and 77 for major chronic conditions. For children ≥8 years, the cutoff scores were 78, 76, and 70, respectively. Pediatric HRQOL varied with health conditions.

Of 7184 eligible participants invited to complete the survey, 4637 (64.5%) completed the PedsQL on admission, and of these 2694 (58.1%) completed the follow-up survey 2 to 8 weeks after discharge. Responsiveness was assessed by calculating improvement scores (difference between follow-up and admission scores). Construct validity was examined by comparing the mean improvement scores for known groups differing by medical complexity. Predictive validity was assessed using Poisson regression to examine associations among admission scores, prolonged length of stay (≥3 days), and 30-day readmissions or emergency department (ED) return visits. Similar models examined the association between improvement scores and risk for 30-day readmissions or ED return visits. The mean (SD) PedsQL improvement scores (scale, 0-100) were 22.1 (22.7) for total, 29.4 (32.4) for physical, and 17.1 (21.0) for psychosocial.

Surgery was indicated for well-defined objective criteria. A consistent operation was performed by 8 surgeons in 1034 patients, median 15 years, (range 6-46); 996 were primary, and 38 redo operations. Surgical patients' mean computed tomography index was 5.46. Mitral valve prolapse was present in 5.4%, Marfan syndrome in 1.1% and scoliosis in 29%. Vacuum bell treatment was introduced for 218 patients who did not meet surgical criteria or were averse to surgery. At primary operation, 1 bar was placed in 49.8%; 2 bars, 49.4%; and 3 bars, 0.7%. There were no deaths. Cardiac perforation occurred in 1 patient who had undergone previous cardiac surgery. Paraplegia after epidural catheter occurred once. Reoperation for bar displacement occurred in 1.8%, hemothorax in 0.3%, and wound infection in 2.9%; 1.4% required surgical drainage. Allergy to stainless steel was identified in 13.7%. A good anatomic outcome was always achieved at bar removal. Recurrence requiring reoperation occurred in 3 primary surgical patients. Two patients developed carinate overcorrection requiring reoperation. Vacuum bell treatment produced better results in younger and less severe cases. A standardized Nuss procedure was performed by multiple surgeons in 1034 patients with good overall safety and results in primary repairs. Vacuum bell treatment is useful.

Their relevance was determined in comparison with other psychological and physiological predictors (depression, anxiety, somatization, cortisol reactivity, pain sensitivity). In 84 young male patients the predictor variables were assessed one day before surgery (correction of chest malformation). Postoperative outcome (subjective pain intensity and pain-related disability) was assessed three (N=84) and six months (N=78) after surgery. Patients were classified into good and poor outcome groups. Patients with high pain intensity three (25%) or six months (14%) after surgery, differed significantly from those low in pain with regard to their preoperative performance in the dot-probe task (high attentional bias towards positive words). A sizeable portion (54%) of patients still felt disabled due to pain after three months and a few patients after six months (13%). These patients were those with high preoperative ratings in the Pain Vigilance and Awareness Questionnaire. The few subjectively disabled patients after six months could be identified in addition by low pressure pain and high cold pain thresholds before surgery. An attentional bias towards positive stimuli prior to surgery may indicate a maladaptive coping style, which avoids necessary confrontation with pain and predisposes patients to chronic postoperative pain. Lasting subjectively felt pain-related disability occurs predominantly in patients with high levels of pain hypervigilance before surgery.

Ultrasound-guided percutaneous cryoneurolysis is an anesthetic modality that offers substantially longer pain relief compared to local anesthetic-based nerve blocks.Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the history, mechanism of action, and use of ultrasound-guided percutaneous cryoneurolysis by anesthesiologists in the setting of acute pain management.Expert opinion: Ultrasound-guided percutaneous cryoneurolysis offers the potential to provide weeks or months of pain relief following surgery or trauma. Compared to continuous local anesthetic-based peripheral nerve blocks, currently the gold standard for providing long duration postoperative analgesia, cryoneurolysis has benefits that include: 1) longer duration measured in weeks or months rather than days; 2) no external reservoir of local anesthetic to be carried by the patient; 3) no risk of infection; and 4) no risk of catheter dislodgement. However, cryoneurolysis can induce a prolonged motor block in addition to the sensory block, decreasing the appropriate indications to those in which potential sensory and motor deficits are acceptable. Additionally, cryoneurolysis of multiple nerves can have a substantial time requirement relative to conventional nerve blocks.", "mesh": ["Acute Pain", "Humans", "Nerve Block", "Pain Management", "Peripheral Nerves", "Ultrasonography"]}

However, it remains unclear whether persistent functional motor deficits remain following cryoneurolysis of mixed sensorimotor peripheral nerves, greatly limiting clinical application of this modality. To help inform future research, we used a rat peroneal nerve injury model to evaluate if cryoneurolysis results in persistent deficits in motor function. Male Lewis rats (n=30) had their common peroneal nerves exposed bilaterally at the proximal lateral margin of the knee and subsequently underwent cryoneurolysis on one limb and sham treatment on the contralateral limb. Outcomes were evaluated on days 3, 14, 30, 90 and 180. The primary end point was motor function, based on ankle dorsiflexion torque. In addition, sensory function was tested based on von Frey's filament sensitivity to the peroneal sensory distribution. A subset of animals was sacrificed following functional testing at each time point, and general tissue morphology, connective tissue deposition, and axon counts were evaluated. Motor deficits in treated limbs were observed at 3 and 14 days but had resolved at time points beyond 1 month. Bilateral sensory deficits were also observed at 3 and 14 days, and also resolved within 1 month. Consistent with motor functional deficits, axon counts trended lower in treated nerves compared with contralateral controls at 3 days; however, axon counts were not significantly different at later time points. When applied to a mixed sensorimotor nerve, cryoneurolysis did not result in persistent motor deficits. © American Society of Regional Anesthesia & Pain Medicine 2020.

There is an indication that incentive spirometry can lead to a reduction in the incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications in these patients. The problem with studies published to date is that there are many limitations, not least of which is the challenge of achieving patient adherence with performing incentive spirometry as prescribed. Despite the lack of evidence, there remains an appetite for persevering with incentive spirometry in the postoperative thoracic surgical patient because it is a relatively inexpensive intervention that motivates many patients to perform regular breathing exercises long after the therapist has moved on to the next patient.

Core temperature (Tc) was manipulated using intravascular heat exchangers and hindleg skin temperature (Tsk) was manipulated by immersion in temperature controlled water. With Tc set 1 degree C above normal, AVA flow was highest at the lowest Tsk tested (34 degrees C); AVAs progressively constricted as Tsk was increased from 34 to 40-41 degrees C, then dilated again as Tsk reached the highest levels tested (42-44 degrees C). Skin CAP flow was not altered by Tsk of 34 to 42 degrees C but was increased at a Tsk of 44 degrees C. Therefore total skin blood flow followed essentially the same pattern as AVA flow; total femoral flow also followed this pattern. When Tc was set 0.5 degrees C below normal, AVA flow was low at all levels of Tsk. It is concluded that Tc plays a dominant role in control of skin blood flow, however, once Tc is at a level requiring increased heat loss, Tsk exerts an extremely potent influence on the nature and magnitude of changes in skin blood flow. The pattern of flow changes appears to reflect principally a negative feedback mechanism aimed at maintaining Tsk at approximately 40 degrees C; this may contrast with mechanisms associated with sweating and/or active vasodilatation in other species.", "mesh": ["Animals", "Arteriovenous Anastomosis", "Body Temperature", "Body Temperature Regulation", "Capillaries", "Hindlimb", "Hot Temperature", "Immersion", "Male", "Regional Blood Flow", "Sheep", "Skin", "Skin Physiological Phenomena", "Skin Temperature", "Vasoconstriction", "Vasodilation"]}

Intercostal nerve blocks provide analgesia but are limited by the duration of the anesthetic. This study compares outcomes of epidural analgesia with intercostal nerve block using liposomal bupivacaine for the treatment of traumatic rib fractures. A retrospective chart review was used to identify patients who received either epidural analgesia or intercostal nerve block with liposomal bupivacaine for the treatment of traumatic rib fractures. Patients were matched in a 1:1 ratio on age, Injury Severity Score, and number of rib fractures. Outcomes included intubations, mechanical ventilation days, ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, and mortality. After matching, 116 patients were included in the study. Patients receiving intercostal nerve blocks with liposomal bupivacaine were less likely to require intubation (3% vs 17%; p = 0.015), had shorter hospital LOS (mean ± SD 8 ± 6 days vs 11 ± 9 days; p = 0.020) and ICU LOS (mean ± SD 2 ± 5 days vs 5 ± 6 days; p = 0.007).

Prospective cohort study. Department of Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery of a tertiary hospital. Seventy-eight consecutive patients undergoing lung cancer surgery were evaluated. Patients were followed up until hospital discharge or death. Fiberoptic bronchoscopies with bilateral protected specimen brush or bronchial aspirates were performed during anesthesia prior to the initiation of the surgical procedure. Sixty-five patients (83%) had perioperative bronchial colonization by either potentially pathogenic microorganisms (PPMs) [28 patients, 36%] or non-potentially pathogenic microorganisms (56 patients, 72%). The 24 patients (31%) with a postoperative respiratory infection (pneumonia, purulent tracheobronchitis, or pleural empyema) had significantly higher perioperative bronchial colonization by PPMs (15 patients [63%] vs 13 patients [24%], p = 0.003) and a higher bacterial index (mean +/- SD, 3.6 +/- 3.3 vs 0.9 +/- 1.4; p = 0.003), compared to patients without infection. The agreement between pathogens found in perioperative evaluation and during postoperative infection was total in 5 patients (21%), partial in 5 patients (21%), and no concordance in 14 patients (58%). In the multivariate analysis, the presence of perioperative airway colonization by a PPM (odds ratio [OR], 6.9; p = 0.001) and a higher postoperative pain score (OR, 4.1; p = 0.014) were independent predictors of postoperative respiratory infection. Adequate control of postoperative pain, as well as the conditions that potentially cause airway colonization by PPMs, could be beneficial in preventing postoperative respiratory infections after lung cancer surgery.", "mesh": ["Aged", "Bronchi", "Bronchoscopy", "Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung", "Female", "Humans", "Lung Neoplasms", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Pneumonectomy", "Prospective Studies", "Respiratory Tract Infections", "Risk Factors"]}
